<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">After 7 years of waiting, the Borderlands series returns with a sequel to the second part. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   Borderlands 3, we are introduced to a number of new vault hunters, new   antagonists and an all-new story in which players will leave Pandora.</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Borderlands   3 players will have the option to depart from Sanctuary, this time a   spaceship, to other locations and planets. This ensures that in addition   to the plains of Pandora, we also get to see some other locations that   all have their own atmosphere. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Although   the old vault hunters and other characters do appear in the story, this   time we take on the role of new vault hunters. Players can choose   between a Siren, an Operator, a Beastmaster or a Gunner class. These   characters bring new skill trees and action skills with them. In it we   come across a lot of new features for the series. Players can adjust   their action skills in different ways and thus combine different skill   trees.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But does Borderlands 3 really bring anything new besides these features? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In short: No. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Borderlands 3 lingers in the eternal meme references and humor that often remains on a poop and pee joke level. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">We are of course 7 years further since the release of the second part. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">While Borderlands 2&#39;s audience has gotten older and more mature, Borderlands itself hasn&#39;t gotten that at all. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Humor is of course something subjective so should not really count in a review. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That will not happen here.</font></font></p><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gameplay &amp; Story</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">So   what do we pay attention to? First, the gameplay. And that&#39;s where this   third installment really shines. The gameplay is great. Weapons sound   and feel good to get started with. The sounds (when they work, but more   on that later) are fantastic. The combat in Borderlands 3 has therefore   not been boring for a moment.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However,   the story does. Handsome Jack has had to make way for the Calypso twins   and will not return in this game. The Calypso twins are a bunch of   streamers whose popularity calls for bandits to fight for them. In this   way the twins have become a kind of gods. Wanting more power, they look   for the vaults. It shouldn&#39;t be the case that they manage to open the   vaults, so you will have to do something about that. You will do this   together with a team of new and returning characters. While this would   normally be a great development, it&#39;s weird to see characters that used   to be playable and had no text now in vulnerable situations.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   addition, each character is very annoying. Characters come and go and   actually do little to push the story in one direction. Borderlands 3   seems to expect that we are already attached to the characters that are   now returning. When these characters in previous parts did not have a   story or text, it remained difficult. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   characters in Borderlands 3 do little more than make arrogant or   intensely lame comments. And the Calypso twins don&#39;t change that at all.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   quests you will encounter are not spectacular either. The familiar   fetch and kill quests return and rarely do anything to spice things up.   The quests range from opening a civilian tent to freeing a character   from a toilet. The best quests in Borderlands 3 are the quests with the   least text.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The new locations bring new enemy types and bosses. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However, the new enemies don&#39;t do much new and look more like the same enemies with different skins. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The boss battles sometimes interrupt that with some cool mechanics. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However, most of the bosses are the standard bullet sponges that run after you while firing. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In addition, some bosses have AOE attacks that cannot be avoided. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A cheap way of ramping up the difficulty that really only adds to the frustration.</font></font></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Performance issues</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">While there are likely some patches coming to fix the issues, Borderlands 3&#39;s performance isn&#39;t what it should be either. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Long   loading screens, the disappearance of all the sound, clipping through   walls and the total hanging of the game come to some extent on all   platforms. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Not what we expected from a major dev like Gearbox. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Borderlands 3 shows exactly what is wrong with the current state of triple A developers. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Creative risks are avoided in every possible way so as to play it safe. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For example, there are few innovative elements and all games are more or less similar. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Borderlands 3 is therefore little different from part 2.</font></font></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In summary</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Basically,   this third installment shows that Gearbox knows how to make a shooter.   The gameplay is good and the weapons make for a great experience.   Gearbox has shown in part 2 that storywriting is also successful.   However, they don&#39;t show that here. In theory Gearbox should be able to   deliver a great game. They don&#39;t do that with Borderlands 3   unfortunately. Part 3 is exactly what part 2 is with some new additions   and will suffice for die-hard fans. However, anyone who is a little more   critical and, after 7 years of waiting, had higher expectations, will   be disappointed.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That&#39;s not to say this third installment is a bad game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Borderlands 3 plays nicely and will be even more fun with a group of friends. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Those   who can accept the story and simply go out to collect loot and turn   enemies into red clouds will be well satisfied with this third part in   the Borderlands series in which the multiplayer and the various options   there are a major addition. be on the experience.</font></font></p></div>
