<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Pokemon has seen some interesting trendings on Twitter and YouTube over the past few months. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit" class="gmail-">It took a while, but we are going to review the most controversial Switch games of this year; </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield.</font></font></h4>                        <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Sword &amp; Shield are the first main-line Pokemon games released for the Nintendo Switch collective. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Fans expected a free-camera open-world game and a less linear experience overall. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Is that what we got with Sword &amp; Shield? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">No, not quite. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Did we get a step forward from the 3DS? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Yes, that again. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This   review will be slightly different, as we will not only look at the game   itself, but also at the controversy and whether this criticism   corresponds with reality.</font></font></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A new story, right?</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Pokemon   is and remains Pokemon. You start out in a house where only your mother   turns out to be, you meet your rival, beat gym leaders, beat the bad   guy, win the Pokemon League and do some post-game content. So it has   been, so it still is. However, there is nothing wrong with this per se.   The formula works and was implemented a little differently each time   with different enemies, different rivals and a slightly different   storyline. This time you notice that GameFreak wants to stick to that   formula, but still wants to do something bigger. This is of course   possible because the Nintendo Switch also allows it graphically and   technically. Until the 3Ds you were a bit stuck with a handheld system   that doesn&#39;t allow much freedom in gameplay due to technical   defects.However, the Nintendo Switch gave birth to games like Breath of   the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey, two games that were linear and now   wilder and freer than ever.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Pokemon   Sword &amp; Shield, on the other hand, are a bit disappointing. The   story gives you more freedom, but far from enough to warrant a new   console. This is where both sides of the coin come into the spotlight.   Yes, the story is fun and there is more post-game content than ever   before. On the other hand, the story is shorter overall and as   streamlined as ever.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can now completely dress up your character the way you want and even go to a hairdresser, which is fun and a nice addition. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However, due to the linearity in the story itself, this does not come out well. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">So   the story is certainly cool, despite a slower start with a lot of   boring dialogues, but doesn&#39;t bring as much impact as Zelda or Mario. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The coolest thing about the entire storyline is that approach to the gym challenges. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">All gym battles take place in a stadium and that makes for a bigger feeling than ever. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There are, of course, other aspects at play here.</font></font><br> </p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Wild Area</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   Wild Area is the highlight of the game for me. You have a free camera   and a large area to explore, find stuff, discover secrets and catch   Pokemon. The Pokemon roam free here in high grass with some stronger   Pokemon that can also be found outside the high grass. This is where the   game shows what it should have been, beyond the graphics aspect that   I&#39;ll get to later. Once you leave the Wild Area, it quickly becomes   linear. The camera is locked and the game suddenly becomes completely   different. The Wild Area is also an area that you will come back to more   often, since it contains Pokemon from all levels, so you can&#39;t catch   all of them immediately. It is an addition that is more than welcome and   that makes the game much better.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In this Wild Area you will also find raid battles. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This means that you and other trainers compete against Dynamix Pokemon and then catch them. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">These battles are not always easy and are a nice addition to the game.</font></font><br> </p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Setting &amp; Graphics</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The Galar Region is a great area to explore. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">From sitting on the train to the alternately themed cities, everything is better than ever. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There are plenty of different types of cities, each with their own theme. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Every city and every route works super strong. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Unfortunately, that experience is a bit withdrawn by the followingâ€¦</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Yes,   the game has a great wide color palette and fun themes. In contrast,   the graphics are not Switch worthy in some areas. For example, trees and   certain textures just look old, almost like playing on the Nintendo DS.   This didn&#39;t bother me personally, but I can see why people can&#39;t be   satisfied with this. Other than that, the Pokemon models and attacks   that already existed hadn&#39;t been redesigned from the bottom up, which   was promised. Still, the variety within the Galar Region and the cool   setting ensured that the game felt very vibrant and played well.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The catching system is also nicely done. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This way you have more ways to catch Pokemon than just random encounters. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   the tall grass you have Pokemon that you do see and also the ones you   don&#39;t and that will attack you with a random encounter. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This   way you can better coordinate which critters you want to catch and you   can travel through the tall grass faster than in previous parts.</font></font><br> </p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">battles</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   battles are again the same, with some extra twists to the formula. For   me, this formula still works great and allows for smoother gameplay,   which I think works well. You can and should give yourself time to think   of your next move and that works well, speaking for me. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   new Pokemon are very well designed except for a few pieces. This is the   first generation in years where my team consists entirely of the new   Pokemon and that is a good sign for the designers. However, a big aspect   of combat is the new Dynamaxing.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Dynamaxing makes your Pokemon in Sword &amp; Shield ten times bigger for a few turns. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This gives your Pokemon new attacks, more HP and provides a new tactical move. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Not only in Online Play, but also in PvE, this feature works better than expected. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Besides that, it also looks cooler.</font></font></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">#GameFreakSong</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You have probably seen the hashtag above often. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Fans are angry, and rightly so. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can&#39;t catch all Pokemon in Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The National Dex got a nice headstone this year. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This didn&#39;t bother me that much at first, until the game made more information public. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   fact is that the NatDex was not present, because GameFreak said that   they had remade all the models for the critters, and that this would   never work with more than 900 Pokemon. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">When I found out that many of these models simply hadn&#39;t been redesigned, a light went on for me too. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">GameFreak lied. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This also counts for me in my final verdict for the game, and it caused a lot of controversy among divided fans.</font></font><br></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield doesn&#39;t do much new, at least the expectations were higher. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s   still a game that I&#39;ve been able to and will enjoy many hours of fun,   but it could have been much, much more than it has become. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">After   a lot of discussions with my two opinions about the game I have come to   the conclusion that this just has to be better next time. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Yes, it is a step in the right direction and yes, it should and could have been much more. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Oh, by the way, will you bring the National Dex back to GameFreak? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Thank you!</font></font></p></div>
