<h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Techland is hard at work creating a worthy sequel to Dying Light. </span></span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have already been able to see Dying Light 2 during Gamescom 2018</span></span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , but before that, we can first get started with another game from Techland.</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">We all know Dying Light. An open world, zombies, parkour, weapons, crafting, rivalry and a lot of gore. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Can you turn this into a battle royale? </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course that's possible! </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It wouldn't surprise me if we see FIFA 20 Battle Royale in a year's time where we can finally bite the bullet with Suarez. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Take notes, EA Games. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anyway, I'm going too far from the topic we're going to talk about today: Bad Blood. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">No, not Taylor Swift's song, but Dying Light's Bad Blood.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cause baby now we got bad blood</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Good  news for anyone who can't get enough of the Dying Light franchise.  Techland recently launched an Early Access version of Dying Light: Bad  Blood on Steam. This two bucks Early Access game gives you access to an  alternate version of Dying Light in which Haran's zombies are the least  you need to worry about. </span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In  this game you compete with a total of 12 players in a smaller version  of the map Haran. The famous tower is the center of the map and the few  blocks with buildings around the tower make up the map in Bad Blood. The  objective of the game is the same as any other zombie game on the  market: Survival. However, you will not only fight against zombies in  this game. Twelve men will storm into the map, but only one can escape.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Once you start the round there are two ways to win: Stay alive last, or escape Haran first. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second is a bit trickier than the first option. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You will only be able to escape if you reach the highest level in a round. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">As soon as one person reaches level 5, a helicopter will fly into the map to free one player from the zombies. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This  must be done before the sunset is over, because we all know what  happens in Haran when the sunlight stops hitting the surface of the  city.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You know it used to be mad love</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Where  in Dying Light you could still work together with friends to survive,  you are now on your own and your previous friends are suddenly murderous  enemies. Once you end up in Haran by likely being dropped on a pile of  garbage bags, you're supposed to equip yourself with the means to keep  anything that has nails and teeth away from you.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Visit the houses for different types of weapons, upgrades and gadgets. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can find knives, axes, sledgehammers, shields, grenades, mines, molotov cocktails and throwing axes to protect yourself. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, there will be some pills and medkits here and there to supplement your health. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you're brave enough, you can also take on another type of NPC in Harran. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">At certain times you will see red smoke and a blue icon will appear on the map. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You will find some tough guys here protecting a box. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is a good chance that there is a shotgun or handgun in this chest.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> It remains a risky job to open this box because you will not only have  to deal with the heavy boys who guard the box, but other players will  also be interested in the shiny metal that is hidden in this box.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now we've got problems</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Encounters with enemy players can be very interesting because the combat in Bad Blood varies enormously. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you have a gun, you can try to shoot your enemy from a distance. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you don't have a gun, a bow and arrow will also do the necessary work from afar. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">However,  if you want to play the tough guy and show that you have big balls,  then storm over and hit him with your sledgehammer to a bloody nose.</span></span><br /> <br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sounds  very simple, but it isn't quite. Shields will block enemy attacks  unless they charge their attack. The downside of charging is that while  charging your attack, you are vulnerable to attacks. The downside to a  charged attack when you're wearing a shield is that you'll recoil when  you take a hit with a charged attack. Right now, with your beautiful  shield, you are vulnerable to attack.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition to a shield, you can also fend off attacks by intervening at the right time by smashing in 'Q' when you get hit. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You will hold back the attack and get a chance to deal a swat while the enemy is still recovering from your defenses. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Is your enemy trying to run away? </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then  you may have already placed a mine somewhere around the corner so that  you can literally take his legs, instead of him taking the legs. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can also shoot arrows into your enemy or throw throwing axes to cause a 'bleed' effect. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your opponent must now remove the object to stop the bleeding.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> If you don't have any items to throw you can also throw your weapons,  it can be very effective against shield users, but at least make sure  you have a weapon on hand!</span></span></p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oh yeah, zombies!</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes  zombies are also a part of this game as this is how you level up.  Levels give you more life points and make you stronger. Zombies will  protect so-called hives. You must extract samples of these hives to earn  XP. There are small, medium and large hives. Of course the zombies with  the larger hives are harder to beat. Most big hives are equipped with a  demolisher. This giant zombie throws big chunks at it. Most medium  hives are accompanied by a Goon. These are the big zombies with an  overall and a makeshift sledgehammer. Also quite dangerous. The  advantage is that all 'non-normal zombies' drop an armor pack that  provides a shield and thus increases your maximum life points.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Again you have to be careful here, because enemy players can watch from  a distance as you tackle a large zombie and strike quickly as soon as  you are vulnerable.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Verdict</span></span></h2>           <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dying Light: Bad Blood is a fast-passed and highly entertaining version of a battle royale game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Techland calls it 'Brutal Royale' and this is certainly the case. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is the most original version of Battle Royale since Fortnite and brings a breath of fresh air to the Battle Royale genre. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The game is currently only $20 on Steam in Early Access but will be free-to-play upon full release. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can spend money on loot stashes or in-game currency to personalize your character. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">No pay-to-win nonsense. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">So that sucks. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if this game would not go free-to-play, twenty euros is really no money for this entertaining game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  range of weapons may not be very high yet and the map becomes very  predictable over time so hopefully some more will be added.</span></span><p>&nbsp;</p><div id="tap-translate"></div>
