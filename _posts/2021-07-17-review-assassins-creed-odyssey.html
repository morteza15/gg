There is really only one real choice, and that is Kassandra. After you choose this fit chick you jump right into the action. The first few hours of the game can be compared to Assassin&#39;s Creed Origins. A secluded island where you learn a bit about how the whole game works. It plays about the same as its predecessor, but has some new and different features here and there. Some features from Origins are now abilities that you must unlock. In addition, there are abilities that you unlock immediately at start-up. After spending several hours on &#39;tutorial island&#39;, &#39;Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey&#39; appears and the game starts for real.WTF? I&#39;ve been at it for like 5 hours and this was just an intro? Malaka, this game is huge!</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><br></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Content for your Drachma</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">It doesn&#39;t matter if you bought the standard edition, Gold Edition, or one of the 27 Special, Limited, or Collector Editions, because the game offers a wealth of content for every version. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Literally and figuratively because Naval combat is back baby! </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">In Odyssey you get your own ship, not to be confused with the Odyssey from Super Mario. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The ship is used to sail from one Greek island to another, but along the way you will come across several ships that might have interesting loot for you.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Not only at sea, but also on land there is plenty to do for your assassin. The main missions lead you slowly through the Greek continent, but if you want to see everything you&#39;ll have to take the plunge and do your own research. There are several side quests and other quests you can complete, some of which, yes, are very repetitive. Conquering camps and the standard eliminate these NPC quests are the filler of Odyssey, but luckily they kind of melt together in the world around you and you often tap multiple objectives in one go, making you feel more like you&#39;re a MMORPG you are playing.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This isn&#39;t a bad thing, by the way, because it makes you less likely to feel like you&#39;re doing repetitive content because the merged objectives in a certain location create a certain approach that will change each encounter depending on the enemies waiting for you and the environment .</font></font></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Playing in the sandbox</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Assassin&#39;s Creed Origins was literally a sandbox. Ubisoft had taken the term Sandbox RPG a bit too literally, but in Odyssey they do the Sandbox RPG even more for good. As a player you feel very free in the world and you also have a choice to make when tackling different objectives. You can choose to fight or show mercy more often. It doesn&#39;t immediately feel like the player choice really has a big impact on the results, but it does have an impact on the way you see your character.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">In addition to the usual quests and side quests, there are several bounties that you can claim, but not only will there be NPCs walking around with a prize on their head, because you will get one on your head anyway. Because of your activities in the Greek countries, there are several people who do not agree and put a price on your head. At this point, you will be hunted by mercenaries. These roam the world and can thwart your missions with their presence. You can pay off your bounties, or choose to kill the person who appointed the bounty.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Don&#39;t feel like doing the dirty jobs of others? </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Then you will also be highly rewarded for discovering the world. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">There are several tombs and secrets in the world to discover that can give you nice rewards that will make your next encounter a little more enjoyable.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Greek Superhero</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">In Odyssey you occasionally feel like you&#39;re playing an Assassin&#39;s Creed game less and I&#39;m not entirely sure whether this is a good or bad sign. You play as a kind of hitman who wants to do dirty jobs for everyone with a bag of gold. You find yourself in the middle of the war between Sparta and Athens, but you don&#39;t really belong to anything and you choose the side that suits you best at that moment.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The conquest missions will form the &#39;final&#39; per area and completely turn the government from Athens to Sparta or vice versa. If you manage to weaken the occupation of one side in territory, a big battle will take place and the territory will be taken over. You can choose to attack or defend an area. So a bit of Assassin&#39;s Creed Risk.</font></font></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Better than gyros</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Gyros may be my favorite dish ever, but it&#39;s not the only thing that looks good. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey is truly a picture. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The world looks incredibly beautiful and for those who want to see all of Ubisoft&#39;s Greece, they are not done watching yet. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Cancel your holiday to Crete and buy Odyssey. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s cheaper anyway and you&#39;ll be busy for weeks in different activities in this version of Greece too. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Personally, I&#39;m a sucker for Greek mythology so I&#39;m far from done with Odyssey.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey is a very large game that offers an awful lot of content that isn&#39;t necessarily new or innovative, but still somehow makes it feel less &#39;of the same&#39; as we&#39;ve come to expect from Ubisoft&#39;s Open World games. A simple conclusion that you can draw with this Assassin&#39;s Creed game is that you will certainly like it if you already liked Origins. The game has progressed on almost every front since Origins and for that you get a very nice and extensive RPG in Odyssey. You may have to make peace with the fact that it feels less like an Assassin&#39;s game, but that doesn&#39;t detract from the fact that this is a rock-solid game.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The game also offers in-game purchases in the form of microtransactions. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">A bit lame if you ask me because you can choose to buy in-game currency with real money to make things simpler, when this is not really necessary. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The sad thing is that the coolest outfits you can get are exclusive to the cash shop. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">In my opinion, this exclusive content is better for a difficult boss, or secret location in the game, but oh well.</font></font></p></div>
