<div dir="ltr"><p><strong><span style="vertical-align:inherit">The Isle of Man TT is an annual event that takes place on the Isle of Man in May – June since its inception in 1907. It is one of the most dangerous racing events in the world. Whoever starts the game will soon know why. Razor sharp turns, difficult controls and wind that make it more difficult for you as you race through villages within millimeters of buildings.</span></strong></p>  <h4><span style="vertical-align:inherit">A big learning curve</span></h4>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">If you turn the throttle hard during your first race, you will probably shoot forward with the front wheel in the air until your rider is on the ground and your opponents pass you effortlessly. TT Isle of Man – Ride on the Edge 2 is not just a racing game. It&#39;s a SIM. And also a sim that will be spicy even for motorcyclists. The controls often don&#39;t quite match what it&#39;s like to ride a motorcycle.</span><br><span style="vertical-align:inherit">In short: TT Isle of Man – Ride on the Edge 2 is hard. This will not suit everyone. Although a sim can of course be a bit difficult, there is a considerable learning curve that will disappoint you from the start. You will be lying next to your motorcycle for a good part of the time. A few game settings will help you with that. You can use ABS, compound brakes, a racing line and more features. Once you have mastered it a bit, you can increase the challenge by turning off anti wheelie systems, switching to separate brakes and shifting and of course turning off the ABS.</span><br><img class="gmail-alignnone gmail-wp-image-59069 gmail-size-full" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TT1.jpeg" alt="TT Racing Bikes" width="1920" height="1080"></p>  <h4><span style="vertical-align:inherit">crash. Very much.</span></h4>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 2 almost presents a Dark Souls like challenge. That is often frustrating because it doesn&#39;t feel very fair right away. If you think about what the TT exactly is, you will understand that this is really fair and realistic. The TT claims a few lives almost every year. The game doesn&#39;t give a Burnout-like view of crashes, but it does show how difficult and how much skill is needed to drive the TT. You will have to memorize every race and every track.</span></p>  <h4><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Beautiful engines</span></h4>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">A lot of time and effort seems to have gone into the game&#39;s graphics. You see this more in some aspects than in others. The engines are of course the star of the show so these look great. Unfortunately, that is not always the case for the environment, the buildings and the riders. The low texture buildings are occasionally an eyesore. Of course you should be racing past it at high speed, but it takes a while to get to that level. It is precisely when you cross the long open roads that you only see the beautiful sunset and you are less disturbed by the surroundings.</span><br><img class="gmail-alignnone gmail-wp-image-59070 gmail-size-full" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TT2.jpeg" alt="TT Isle of Man" width="1920" height="1080"></p>  <h4><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Almost but not quite</span></h4>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">All in all, TT Isle of Man – ride on the edge 2 provides an interesting experience that just misses the mark. The controls and physics are not completely faithful to real motorcycling and some details are really missing. For example, you will see dirt splashing on your visor and windshield during a race in first person view, but the sound design is less. The downshift does not give the desired popping of the exhaust and you hear your tires do little. Every now and then you will have to fight against the wind and you will also hear it, but that is the extreme. It&#39;s hard to get lost in this game. You will never hear squeaky tires, when you hit a building with 200 kilometers you don&#39;t hear much and the noises when colliding with opponents are almost non-existent. All in all, this makes for a somewhat lesser experience.</span></p>  <h4><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</span></h4>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">TT Isle of Man provides a mediocre experience that might be just enough for true motorcycle enthusiasts. Due to contracts and representation of real bikers, the game is tied to certain brands, outfits and bikes. So there is not much choice in engines and there is little customization besides performance tuning. The real completionists will start in the open world challenge mode with different assignments in order to get all the perks, parts and decals together. The casual players will probably get bored quickly. These players will probably be very busy with the caraar mode which is not very different from what other racing sims do. You make choices between certain races in a calendar.That means that you sometimes have to make strategic choices between which races to drive and which to pass. This requires some thinking every now and then because you can bring in certain sponsors and therefore also certain engines by performing well in the right races.</span><br><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Anyone who just bites through and can make peace with the lack of engines and options and of course the spicy learning curve will have a great time with TT Isle of Man. When you finally understand how the controls work and you manage to get through a bend at lightning speed, it really gives you a good feeling. </span><br><span style="vertical-align:inherit">For most players, it probably won&#39;t get that far.</span></p></div>
