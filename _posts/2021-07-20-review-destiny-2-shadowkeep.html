<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Destiny   2 got off to a rough start, but has proven that they can handle the   &#39;live service&#39; earning system in their own unique way. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game is constantly building towards something bigger and now the long-awaited new update is finally here: Shadowkeep!</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">With Shadowkeep, the heroes go to the moon. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Of course we already know this area from the first part. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However, Bungie has reimagined the map and packed it with new areas and gameplay elements. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">From narrow adjustments to big changes, The Moon is back!</font></font></p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/LFYJTudJ540/maxresdefault.webp" width="546" height="307"><br><br>            <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The Moon</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Players   return to the moon in search of Eris Morn, a Destiny fan favorite and   also a mysterious character. The storytelling is again at Destiny level,   and then both are good and less great. Some dialogues are boring and   can be stretched, but once the action bits are there, you once again   have the feeling that you are one of the heroes in an eternal story.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Shadowkeep&#39;s   storyline isn&#39;t the longest. Most were blown through in 3 to 4 hours, I   took it a little slower and was even through in 5 and a half hours.   This is of course part of the whole live service aspect, where an   expansion grows into one big whole over the months. But I already wanted   more. This makes sense, of course, but the fact that there&#39;s more   content to come does reassure me for the future of the game, especially   without Activision.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   campaign is also a bit like we are used to, you fight through an arena   with &#39;trash monsters&#39;, walk through a corridor or tunnel, get to the   next arena and kill a mini-boss. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That&#39;s how it goes for a while. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This was done for a reason I can&#39;t spoil, but I missed some freedom in that. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You will encounter boss fights that you probably already know, as this storyline is partly a trip to the past.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Giveth, and taketh away</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">While Shadowkeep brings a number of new features, a few old ones will not return. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There is a new Nightfall variant, there are new Crucible playlists and there are new Strikes. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But there&#39;s also a lot of the same content that you&#39;ll have to grind through. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For example, what isn&#39;t there is a completely new world or vendor loot.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Also   there are few new weapons, it&#39;s not that they are not there at all, but   scarcity is certainly present. Of course, for Bungie it was a matter of   trial and error in a new environment without Activision and with   limited resources available. Despite that, they have delivered a   fantastic new part of an existing product. What immediately stood out   was how quickly you found new stuff and better gear, the game feels more   rewarding and therefore plays a little better. Too bad that this causes   a bit of problems here and there due to the scarcity of completely new   weapons.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The Destiny formula works and therefore it seems strange to make big changes. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Why fix it if it ain&#39;t broke? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That may be true, but the lack of new features and the reuse of many old assets is immediately noticeable. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s   very fortunate that the game just shoots away nicely and that there are   enough fans who understand that Bungie has to find their way again</font></font></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">New Light</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Destiny 2 comes with one big advantage. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game can be played for free from Shadowkeep under the name: New Light. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Base game content can now be played by anyone for free and for nothing. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This brought some minor server issues, but they were resolved within hours if not minutes. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The developers show that they are far from finished with the well-deserved success of this looter shooter. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Players can  </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">each </font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">area now for free play, regardless of all new features, storylines and bonuses. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However, as a new player you can just go to the moon and play with your friends. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can then join patrol groups or friends in playing patrols and Lost Sectors. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">As a free player you also have access to Strikes, Crucibles and the Gambit from the base game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This is an almost perfect addition to rake in new players to the game, and it works!</font></font></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">We are very curious about the rest of Shadowkeep and the future for this virtually free-to-play looter shooter. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Shadowkeep is a welcome addition that isn&#39;t perfect, but shows exactly why Bungie is passionate about the cause. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The expansion feels more rewarding and plays just as well as previous content, despite the lack of some well-known features. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">We can definitely recommend Shadowkeep, especially for regular fans of the game!</font></font></p></div>
