<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Ready for the main Pokémon line? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Finished with Sword and Shield? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Still a Pokemon fan? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Then a re-make of the well-known Mystery Dungeon has come on the market for you!</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX is a mouthful. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   the main line Pokémon games, of course, we mainly follow the child who   goes out into the wide world to defeat the Pokémon League, collect   Pokémon and explore areas. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But what if that kid wakes up one day as a Pokémon? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That&#39;s where Mystery Dungeon begins. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Rescue Team DX is a remake of the old DS and Advance games. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You start the game with your transformation into Pokémon, although you have no idea why or how this happened. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You are all asked questions about your personality, from there a Pokémon is selected that you already play. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Then you can choose a buddy. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If you don&#39;t agree with the choice the game makes for you, you are free to change.</font></font></p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/cfMeYFhANfs/maxresdefault.webp" width="546" height="307"><br><br>            <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">What if</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Then,   as a Pokémon, you enter a world where you learn more about how certain   Pokémon behave. It&#39;s almost like an Animal Planet episode, only the   animals talk for themselves. But, while humanity is concerned about a   performance society and social media, Pokémon are constantly helping   each other. That is why your rescue team will also be formed! Mystery   Dungeon unfortunately lacks some depth in the story. The quests you get   are stories that you have probably heard before in different RPGs.   Fortunately, that should not spoil the fun for many.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   are placed in randomly generated dungeons, where you then scour area   after area to defeat enemies, find items and complete your quests. Not   to mention from a top-down perspective! However, the enemy Pokémon will   not attack until you do so first. This gives you the chance to think   about your next move. The game plays smoothly, but is not very intuitive   when it comes to combat. It all feels quite linear and while this   wasn&#39;t much of a problem in the past, it&#39;s a little less good in 2020.   That being said, this game is great for just relaxing.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">What   makes the game a bit more challenging is that you also get hungry and   of course your HP points drop after each battle. You&#39;re supposed to hold   this all up while you try to save other Pokémon! After a few hours and   dungeons it becomes quite a resource puzzle. Sometimes this also means   that you should be able to say that you are going back for a while and   try again later. The rogue-like element that you lose all your stuff   when you die is also present here. So make sure you leave enough and   only take the essentials with you.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can upgrade your team with different moves, where you can take on the field with four at the same time. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can get these moves in different ways, including the well-known TM. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Mystery Dungeon will keep you busy strategically figuring out the next dungeon long enough. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You are always in a team. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Where the main line games can feel lonely at times, in Mystery Dungeon DX you always have someone to converge with. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Pokémon follow and help each other and that&#39;s what this game is about. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Besides that, the game is accessible to both young and old. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">What I did run into is the controls. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I understand that you work in a dungeon with the whole &#39;boxes&#39; idea, but the controls in a dungeon felt very stiff to me.</font></font><br> </p>                       <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Graphics and sound</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">What is a hit for some and a miss for others, mainly revolves around the graphical aspect. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You love it, or you don&#39;t. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I personally really like the graphic brushed style. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Also, the Pokémon themselves are as cute as can be. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Sometimes you just miss that little bit of extra detail, which could have made a scene a little more lively. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">All in all I really like the art-style in Mystery Dungeon. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The same goes for the sound. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The music is great and the in-game sounds are nice too. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But sometimes it just doesn&#39;t feel strong enough here.</font></font></p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For who is it?</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Mystery Dungeon is a separate game and not everyone will like the game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Yes, there are some things missing here and there, but who exactly is the game intended for? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   any case, the die-hard Pokémon fans will pick up the game again and   these players will only appreciate the grind that Mystery Dungeon can   sometimes be. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This of course also gives you more playing time! </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But,   the game is also for those who have a Switch Lite, in my opinion this   is a real handheld game and that&#39;s how it should be played. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Besides   that, for anyone looking for something different from the normal   Pokémon experience, the game is a kind of fresh breeze that howls   through the living room on a warm Wednesday afternoon.</font></font><br> </p>                       <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX is not for everyone and certainly not a perfect game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Some aspects are missing here and there, but all in all, the game is a unique thing. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Mystery Dungeon has a charm that many rogue-like games lack. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game is also attractive for different ages. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Would I recommend the game at full price? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Maybe not for everyone. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I myself would rather buy it at 30-40 Euros, but if you are a real fan then you probably already have the game! </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Sometimes   it feels like a second-life simulator, you want to keep track of how   your Pokémon are doing on a daily basis and that makes the game   attractive to come back to.</font></font></p></div>
