<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Finally we got an old trusted Call of Duty again. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">With Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Activision is going back to its roots. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Simple military combat without all those weird futuristic frills. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Something that has been called for by the game&#39;s loyal fan base for years. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game is now a week old and we have played the game extensively for you. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can find our findings today in our review of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.</font></font></h4>            <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Did   we miss Captain Price? Yes certainly. As soon as Captain Price came   into the picture during the Call of Duty Modern Warfare campaign, the   kid in me jumped out of his seat. As a teenager, I spent hours   sympathizing with Captain Price&#39;s adventures in the original Modern   Warfare series. At the time, I also totally disagreed that Captain Price   had left the game. However, he is now back and how. The story is told   at a fast pace and we fight and meet Captain Price for the mission. We   begin the story with the search for chemical weapons that would be in   the hands of the terrorists. However, this appears to be in the hands of   the Russians. Unfortunately your mission fails and the chemical weapons   end up in the hands of terrorists.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There is a lot of controversy surrounding the campaign mode of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For example, many players think that the Russians are placed in a very bad light. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game feels very patriotic. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">America is number one and all. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But we don&#39;t quite agree with that. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">When you think about the story longer, you notice that you are mainly fighting the terrorists. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Something that was also the case in the previous Modern Warfare games. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For example, the game is heavily reviewed on Metacritic. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Unfair in my opinion. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The story and way of playing gives me back the old familiar feeling. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s like I&#39;m back in Modern Warfare 2 again.</font></font></p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/OGjUSyETd1U/maxresdefault.webp" width="546" height="307"><br><br>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">multiplayer</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Multiplayer   is an ambiguous concept. On the one hand they are taking on a new   management, but on the other hand it remains the good old Call of Duty.   You could almost say an identity crisis. The game wants to switch to a   slightly more tactical way of playing but, on the other hand, keeps that   fast flow on some maps. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that per se, but it   does spark discussions on Reddit. We ourselves had to get into some   games for a while, but once you&#39;re in the flow, the multiplayer plays   away nicely, especially if you want to pop a few games!</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There   are tons of weapons and skins to unlock through leveling up and   completing challenges. Besides that, each weapon can have dozens of   attachments. Normally there are always specific scopes or barrels that   are some kind of meta and that everyone uses. Fortunately, I notice that   this is a bit better distributed in Modern Warfare. When you play   you notice that everyone customizes their own weapons differently. This   also makes for a better progression system in the game. You have a lot   more to unlock and that also gives some satisfaction compared to   unlocking up to three scopes or something.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   terms of maps, my opinion is a bit divided. There are many good maps   and there is enough variation between large, small, open or closed.   However, there&#39;s also a map in London that feels pretty broken and where   spawn kill can be used against you way too easily. Besides that, there   is quite a bit of variation and you notice that players are already   starting to understand how the maps should be played. You can also   unlock operators, which doesn&#39;t immediately add much depth, but is nice   for some extra variation.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Ground   War, on the other hand, still has its problems. There are two large   maps to play, the familiar one from the beta and a new one with   apartment buildings and all the trimmings. You notice that killstreaks   are still a problem, given that they are used way too often, which   sometimes makes it too chaotic. Also the tanks are way too strong and   you can shoot a little faster than I would like. Besides that, they   handle these game modes well. Gun Fight, the 2v2 mode, is a relief and   this game mode plays nicely. What is also striking is the amount of   modes that are available. There is plenty to play for every kind of fps   fan.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">All   in all, the multiplayer is done fantastically and the problems that   exist can be solved through player feedback to the developers. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This, of course, provided the developers do something with it, which we do assume. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You really get that old Call of Duty feeling here, which is refreshing where necessary! </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Will we see you online?</font></font></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">CPU and Discord Issues</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Something that Malvin and Ellen from our editors have encountered, as well as many other people, is the CPU problems. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Your CPU will be 100% used by the game after startup, so you can no longer understand each other in Discord. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This issue can be resolved by setting the game priority to normal, but it shouldn&#39;t and should have been resolved already. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Many people suffer from this problem and for some Xbox players even the entire Xbox crashes. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This could have been better in my opinion.</font></font></p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> is a great game that goes back to its roots. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">When playing the campaign, the game feels like we&#39;ve never been away from the previous Modern Warfare parts. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Although there is a controversy surrounding the story, I personally think it is not that bad. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">After all, you&#39;re fighting terrorists and their nationality shouldn&#39;t matter that much. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Graphically, the game looks good and there is little to complain about. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The direction Activision has chosen by going back is a successful move and meets the needs of the fan base.</font></font></p></div>
