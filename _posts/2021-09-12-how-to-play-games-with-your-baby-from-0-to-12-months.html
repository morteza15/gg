The games are not complicated yet, but help your baby to develop further in different areas.</p><p>You can't really play games with your baby in the first weeks of his life. He is still developing. His brain has yet to grow and he has yet to acquire various motor skills. So don't expect him to understand, like or be able to play a game right away. Just try again later. Who knows, it might suddenly become your baby's favorite game.</p><h2>Why play baby games?</h2><p>Playing games with your baby is fun and useful for several reasons. It helps your child with the following things:</p><ul><li><strong>The development of the brain. </strong>By playing games, your baby learns many new things. He gains new experiences and learns to make new connections . Your baby learns a lot through repetition : through this he will discover and recognize patterns. So feel free to play your favorite games often.</li><li><strong>The motor development. </strong>Many baby games and activities require your baby to exercise physically. As a result, these games help him with his motor development . Just think of rolling over , grabbing , and clapping . But fine motor skills are also often included in games, such as the tweezer grip .</li><li><strong>The social-emotional development. </strong> Playing together , sharing is not quite for you baby. Still, playing games with your baby creates a good bond between you. You lay the foundation for the rest of his life. And as soon as your child is a little older, he learns through games to play (and share) together.</li><li><strong>Language and speech development. </strong>Many activities and games revolve around sounds, sounds and melodies, such as reading aloud and singing songs together. This encourages your baby 's language development .</li><li><strong>Relaxation. </strong>Playing games with your baby is relaxing. Not only for your child, but also for you.</li></ul><h2>Safety first</h2><p>Always provide a safe environment during activities and don't force your baby to do anything he doesn't want to or can't do yet. Every child develops in its own way and at its own pace. Are you concerned about your baby's development? Please contact the consultation office or the general practitioner.</p><h2>Baby games per month</h2><p>Below are different baby games divided according to the age of your baby. Of course you can also play the games in other months. Peekaboo is always fun and there is no end to the fun of singing songs. When playing games with your baby, pay particular attention to the development of your own child and his interests.</p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.24baby.nl/2018/11/Babyspelletjes.jpg" alt="baby games" /><p>Also read:</p><h4>The best baby games for your baby from 13 to 24 months</h4><h2 id="month0">Baby games month 0</h2><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.24baby.nl/2018/03/Baby-spelletjes-staren-360x240.jpg" alt="baby staring games" /><h3>Eyeball</h3><p>Your baby will not be able to see well in the first month after birth, because his eyes have not fully developed. Your baby sees clearly between about 20 to 30 cm away. You can train your little one's eye muscles and sight by letting him follow you with his eyes. Keep your face close to his head (20-30 cm) and move slowly back and forth. Your baby will try to keep a close eye on his favorite view (your face) and try to follow you. It probably doesn't work that well yet, but that doesn't matter. You still have plenty of time to practice. <br /><strong>Good for: </strong> developing your baby's vision and eye muscles</p><h3>cuddle butt</h3><p>The first few weeks you still have to get used to each other.

So regularly take the time to cuddle extensively and enjoy that soft baby skin. <br /><strong>Good for: </strong> bonding between you and your baby , feeling safe and familiar</p><h3>House tour</h3><p>Your baby enjoys your presence and attention, and likes nothing more than lying in your arms.

That's [Your baby's name]</em> !&rdquo; and point to your child in the mirror. He will admire himself, but not yet realize that it is himself.

Combine this with solid food discovery and you have a fun eating game! Show your baby something tasty, for example a piece of cucumber, and hide it under a tea towel. Then let your child lift the tea towel. <em>Wow, there's the piece of cucumber!</em> A fun way to stimulate your child's object permanence.</p><p>When your child is a bit older, you can make this game even more exciting. Put different types of food in different containers with lids. Let your child remove the lids from the containers and discover what treats are waiting for him. Lets eat. <br /><strong>Good for: </strong> object permanence , cause and effect , fine motor skills</p><h3>Your handbag</h3><p>Nothing is more interesting than your handbag, you probably noticed that already. All those little frills that you collect are very interesting for your baby. But they are less suitable for playing with and putting in the mouth . Therefore, give your baby its own handbag. Take your old handbag out of the closet and put all kinds of things in it that you also have in your bag: old loyalty cards, an empty wallet, an (empty) marker, toys, tissues and so on.</p><p>Take the bag with you when you go out.

Unwrapping presents is therefore a fun baby game that you can play not only on his birthday , but always.</p><p>Pack toys that your little one already has and let him unpack them over and over again. Every time your child is curious about what is in the paper. And every time he is surprised what comes out of the package. Endless fun to play. Do you want to spoil your child extra on his birthday? Then treat him to a smash cake .
