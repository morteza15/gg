<p>&nbsp;</p><h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The holiday period has been going on for a while now, many are traveling by plane or by car. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">But his journey can of course lead to a bit of boredom. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">And Nintendo is now responding well to that, via their Switch. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">With GoVacation you have a fun and entertaining game to play in the back seat of the car, or on the plane.</span></span></h4>           <p><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">GoVacation is in true the successor to the Wii Sports and its peers. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">With your own Mii you can go on holiday digitally in your Switch. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Together with your Mii you travel to the holiday island of Kawawii. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Conveniently enough, there are four different resorts on this island. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have a beach, mountains, snow and a city resort. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The nice thing about the four resorts is that the game remains current for every holiday period. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, now it is a wonderfully warm summer, and what would suit it better than a beautiful beach resort? </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in a few months we will go into winter again at Christmas, which means playing in the snow in a beautiful snow resort. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because just like most games from Nintendo and Bandai Namco, the game looks fantastic again.</span></span></p><p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"></span></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><a href="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GoVacation.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="450" data-original-width="800" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GoVacation.jpg" /></a></span></span></div><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><br />&nbsp;</span></span><p></p>           <h3><span style="color: #ff7f00;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Diversity</span></span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Four  different resorts is just a taste of how diverse GoVacation really is.  The game contains over 50 mini games. However, a small downside to this  is that the quality of the mini games sometimes leaves something to be  desired. Some mini games are very easy to play and the controls are very  simplified. Each racing variant mini game is easy to beat from the  computer. In beach volleyball all you have to do is hit the ball back  and time it with a smash. Perhaps they should have put less mini games  in it and done a bit more on the quality of the mini games. But the  downside of this is of course that the game is very accessible for young  children. And besides, it doesn't affect the fun you have when you play  GoVacation together with family or friends.</span></span><br /> <br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each  resort has its own set of mini-games that fit in well with the  environment of the resort. Surfing and diving on the beach resort,  horseback riding and kayaking in the mountains, skating and air hockey  in the city and snowboarding or snowball fight in the snow resort. The  resorts are also quite large and you can roam free in every area. To  make exploring the areas easier, each resort also has its own set of  means of transport. Jet ski, horse, snowboard and rollerblades are some  of these modes of transport. Apart from the fact that it is fun to  explore the area, you can also find or do a number of things, such as  search for treasure chests or take a picture.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another point of diversity is for the Sims players among us. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In GoVacation you also get your own villa. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can fully customize this inside with furniture that you can play freely. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can also adjust the outside of your villa with various layouts. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even during the design of your villa, we still run into the controls of the game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It feels and goes slow, putting down and placing is very simplistic. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">But that is also good for the young players.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h3><span style="color: #ff7f00;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vacation time and time again</span></span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">GoVacation is a real game that you can play again and again. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you complete a mini game you get extra challenges for the same mini game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a valuable addition for the more demanding gamer among us. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The challenges are there to make the mini game more challenging and difficult. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">With this Nintendo tries to keep the game interesting for the demanding gamer. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">And just like its predecessors, the game is great for parties with friends and family. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can play the game up to four players. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">And  it's not only the mini games that you can play with four people, but  you can also freely roam over the island separately from each other.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h3><span style="color: #ff7f00;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Verdict</span></span></span></h3>           <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  diversity that GoVacation offers in the game is both a plus and a minus  point, but a bit more plus than minus. All the mini games are all  entertaining and well placed in their theme. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is a pity, however, that the gameplay of the mini games is simplified for the average gamer. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">But on the other hand, it is playable for practically any age. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Free roaming is very entertaining with the different modes of transport. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">A very good and entertaining game for all ages. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Great for entertaining your passengers when you make a long journey to your vacation destination. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">But also certainly entertaining at home with friends or family. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">So go on holiday with GoVacation on your Nintendo Switch </span></span><div id="tap-translate"></div><div id="tap-translate"></div>
