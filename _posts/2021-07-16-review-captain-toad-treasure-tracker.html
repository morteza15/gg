<h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mario's little friend Toad is back with a new game and adventure. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Captian Toad sets out again in search of the gold stars and diamonds. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Together with his girlfriend Toadette, they are ready to walk through the various puzzles again. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">How entertaining is this new game: Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker? </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">We played the game on the Nintendo Switch version.</span></span></h4>           <p></p>           <h3><span style="color: #ff7f00;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Story</span></span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">During  the first level, we see Captain Toad and Toadette chasing a gold star.  But unfortunately for the pair, Wingo steals the found star. Toadette is  then smart enough to hold on to the star. Together they disappear on  the horizon, leaving Captain Toad behind. Captain Toad doesn't let this  pass him by and he goes looking for Toadette and the star. The story  takes you through a number of levels that are like puzzles. Between the  levels we see short movies with an update of the story. But the story is  not the main feature of Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker. Especially  since the story is not very interesting and long.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The game mainly revolves around the puzzle element. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each level is built up like a puzzle. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">By means of various actions that you can do, the level changes so that you can get to different places. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, you can make objects move to get higher, or to enter somewhere. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can also turn pieces of the level to get to the other side. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">To make it more difficult, there are regular enemies that try to stop you.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h3><span style="color: #ff7f00;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Gameplay</span></span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In  addition to finding diamonds and the gold star, each level has some  additional goals. Each level has an explicit goal such as: get x amount  of coins, defeat all shy guys or find the golden mushroom. But every  level also gets a hide and seek game after you've completed it. You can  enter a pixelated Toad into the level. Your goal then becomes to search  the level for the pixelated Toad. When you have found it, click on it  and you have won.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  interesting thing about this game is, you can actually play the game in  different ways. The essence remains the same, but the game still feels  different. On the Nintendo Switch you can play the game as a handheld,  on the TV and together with a friend. In handheld mode you can use the  touch screen and the motion controls. In some levels you can throw/shoot  with turnips. You can then aim with the joysticks but also with the  Switch motion. With the touch screen you can make various objects move  and rotate. These are fun and work well additions to the gameplay.</span></span><br /> <br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">When  you place the Nintendo Switch in its docking bay and you play on your  TV, the gameplay changes partially. Instead of having a touch screen,  you now have a pointer that you can control with the motion of your joy  cons or Switch controller. With that pointer you can do the same options  as on the touch screen, but it still feels like a different way of  playing. You can also briefly paralyze enemies with the pointer. You  control the pointer through the motion option that is incorporated in  the controllers.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker can also be played with two people. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you play the game together, one controls Captain Toad and the other controls the pointer. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the player who controls Captain Toad, not much changes. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The person operating the pointer does get a bit more options than when you play the game alone. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can also shoot extra turnips with the pointer. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">With this you can, for example, collect coins or shoot enemies. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The game becomes considerably easier when you play it together. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This makes the game a lot more fun to play with children, for example. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">As long as you are the pointer yourself, you can help and guide your child through all puzzle levels.</span></span></p>           <h3><br /></h3>           <h3><span style="color: #ff7f00;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span class="" style="vertical-align: inherit;">Verdict</span></span></span></h3>           <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Captain  Toad: Treasure Tracker is a fun and entertaining puzzle game. The  diversity of puzzles is well present. The further you go, the more  challenging the puzzles become. There is also a good replay value in the  game. You can play each level again, where you can look for a pixelated  Toad. Also, each level has a specific goal, which you don't achieve  immediately every time. The game is easy to play for younger players.  Because you can play together, you would be able to play the game with  your child, nephew or niece.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because you can play on the Switch in several ways, it makes this game even more fun. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nintendo has again done its best to use as much of the Switch as possible. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is highly recommended for anyone who likes casual puzzle games. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition to the Nintendo Switch version, you can also play the game on the Nintendo 3DS. </span></span><p>&nbsp;</p><div id="tap-translate"></div>
