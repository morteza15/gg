<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Control is a game that wasn&#39;t big on my radar. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">After having played the game extensively, I am glad that the game was present as a small point on the radar. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A true masterpiece by Remedy, known for Quantum Break, Alan Wake and Max Payne.</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It   is extremely difficult to describe exactly what Control is about. After   playing through the story and almost all the side-quests and boss   fights, it&#39;s still a messy event, but only in a positive way. You take   on the role of Jesse in search of the Bureau of Control. For years you   searched, but you could not find it. Suddenly you find it, as if it had   to be. The Bureau of Control is a physical building, but it is in a   super-physical law. You soon notice that the building you are in is not   the most ordinary complex.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You walk down a corridor and meet Ahti, the janitor. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You start talking to him and he thinks you are the new assistant janitor. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Ahti has a special accent and not everything he says makes sense. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">He will direct you to the director&#39;s office. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You continue your way through the hallway and come to a familiar spot. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You were here just now, but now there is suddenly an elevator. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It just wasn&#39;t there yet. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">At this point you are already finding out that not everything is straight forward in this office. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You make your way to the director&#39;s office and find him dead on the floor. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You pick up his pistol, the service weapon, and suddenly you are the new director. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Now it&#39;s really starting to get weird.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The Hiss</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   agency has been hit by a strange &quot;something&quot; they call the Hiss. It   takes over employees and makes them hostile. In some cases it changes   the body in such a way that you encounter different kinds of enemies   during the game. Standard agents, but also snipers and rocket launchers.   It doesn&#39;t take long before you encounter strange shapes such as flying   persons in chairs or exploding enemies. Once they were all people who   worked for the agency. Now they have been taken over by the Hiss that   nobody knows anything specific about yet.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Where does the Hiss come from? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The agency works under strict secrecy and from the outside everything looks &#39;normal&#39; enough. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Once   everything starts to warp you know there is more to it and that is the   fact that there are several portals to a place called the &#39;Astral   Plane&#39;. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This dimension is linked to the desk and houses several mysterious objects that the agency is or has researched. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It is also where Objects of Power are located. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">These objects give you special powers. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Furthermore, there are Altered Items that all react differently and carry certain conditions. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You will have to disable some of these objects to make the desk a safer place.</font></font></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Control</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Something   you definitely don&#39;t have while playing is the control. Not at all in   the beginning. You can compare the game a bit with a Metroidvania or   Resident Evil game. Despite being the director you start with Clearance   Level 1. In total there are 6. As you play through the story you get new   levels to discover new areas. In addition, there are certain areas that   you have to unlock during the game in other ways. You can navigate the   maze in which you find yourself a little faster thanks to the so-called   Control Points. You can fast-travel between these points, but don&#39;t make   navigating any easier. It is and always will be a big maze with many   question marks.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Certain places in the office can only be reached by entering a threshold. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">These are again alternate dimensions that sometimes seem very much to the normal world. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A frequently recurring threshold is the motel. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In this motel you will always have to solve a puzzle to find a key in one of the motel rooms. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Once found you will be able to open the door where you can open the real world passage to another part of the office.</font></font></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gameplay</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Control   plays like an action game and a great one too. The game is not easy, so   you quickly have to adapt to the environment and the enemies you have   to deal with. You have a service weapon that can take different forms.   You start with a handgun mode, but later you get a shotgun mode, SMG   mode and more. You can upgrade all these forms depending on each other   and provide them with such mods. For example, these mods provide more   damage, more headshot damage, less recoil and so on. In certain   situations, you may want to switch modes and mods to make your collision   a little smoother.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">During   the game you will always unlock new powers which you can also upgrade   separately from each other. For each main or side mission you will   receive power points to distribute. Soon you will unlock the power that   allows you to pick up objects, make them hover and fire at your enemy.   This is a very powerful attack and it is also a pleasure to hurl an   object at your enemies. For example, you can upgrade this power with   extra damage, but also launch bodies and larger objects such as   forklifts.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Enemies don&#39;t just let you attack but do everything they can to get back at you and the AI isn&#39;t exactly stupid. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">They try to dodge your attacks and are generally very aggressive. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There is no difficulty in the game so you always play the way the developers envisioned. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">When you get hit you lose health points, but there are no medkits. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The only way you can fill up your life bar is murder. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Enemies drop a matter when they are dead. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This matter will replenish your life bar. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There are mods that allow matter to recover more health, or allow you to have more health.</font></font></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Graphically very strong</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">To   complete the whole picture, the game looks very good graphically.   Graphically one of the strongest games of this generation in my opinion and   this is mainly due to the art direction, but also mainly because of the   world around you and how it reacts to your actions. Almost everything   around you is physical. This means that the world around you is affected   by, for example, your attacks.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   can pick up chairs, desks, tables and all kinds of stuff to launch.   Everything that stands in your way will be demolished or blown over and   even walls, elevations and railings will break down. If there are no   objects nearby to fire, Jesse will pull a piece of concrete out of the   wall or floor and the damage will continue to show as long as you are in   the area. The extent to which everything works together is so   beautifully done. A trend that we certainly want to see grow further.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Unfortunately, this also comes with the downside and this is the performance. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   moments where many enemies come together and you cheerfully start   demolishing everything around you, you will notice that the frames drop   just as fast as the number of chairs around you. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">At   times this can last quite a while, making certain encounters   unintentionally a lot more difficult because everything does not go so   smoothly.</font></font></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Control </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">is   one of the strangest, most interesting, but above all most beautiful   games of this generation. A real masterpiece from Remedy if you ask me   and we hope to see more from Jesse and the Bureau of Control in the   future. The game leaves more questions at the end than it answers, but   the experience was unprecedented! The story is linear, but there are   plenty of side missions. It only gets really challenging when you look   beyond your nose and find out that there are serious threats lurking in   the Bureau. It is one of the most beautiful elaborations of a   metroidvania level design with many unique and strange places with more   than enough variety. The checkpoints can occasionally be a hindrance as   these are also the checkpoints if you die.Every now and then you have to   travel back a bit to try an encounter again. Fortunately, that is the   only downside of the game in terms of design and the rest is just   perfect. Control is a game that you must have played this generation.   The characters, the story, the gameplay and how everything works is   simply magnificent.</font></font></p></div>
