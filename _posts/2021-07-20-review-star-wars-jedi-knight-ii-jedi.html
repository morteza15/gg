<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Seventeen   years ago we saw a new Star Wars game coming out for the Nintendo   Gamecube called: Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Seventeen years later, the makers thought to breathe new life into this game and port the game to the Nintendo Switch. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game has been out for a while now and we have also started working on it. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Because how bad is it to play a classic? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Maybe a little worse than we thought.</font></font></h4>            <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Star   Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast is set a few years after the events   of Return of the Jedi. The story revolves around Kyle Katarn. Kyle   Katarn is an ex Jedi who has taken on the life of a mercenary. Kyle   begins the story with a number of laser blasters at his disposal to   later relearn how to use his Jedi powers and light saber. From then on   the game really starts and you go from a first person shooter to a third   person hack and slash game. With your Jedi powers you go out and you   have to solve the necessary puzzles of the game. In the meantime you can   quietly hack away at the enemy stormtroopers.</font></font></p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/pLqVIw_Qz8A/maxresdefault.webp" width="546" height="307"><br><br><p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"></font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">With the Nintendo Switch, Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast lets you use the built-in gyroscope. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For the first person shooter part that worked quite annoying. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In handheld mode or with a pro controller, the aiming was so sensitive that you constantly had the idea that you were wrong. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The fact that the hitboxes on your opponents are also small does not make shooting in the game any better. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But once the lightsaber is in hand, the game plays like a charm. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The combat is smooth and the use of your Jedi powers is fine. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In addition to the fact that the story only becomes interesting after your lightsaber, this also applies to the gameplay.</font></font></p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">graphics</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Star   Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast is an obvious port to Nintendo   Switch. On the one hand, it has a certain charm to see the game with the   full pixel layer. But on the other hand, we&#39;ve also been spoiled a bit   with remakes like The Legend of Zelda: Link&#39;s Awakening. Couldn&#39;t </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Aspyr Media</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">   , the publisher, have chosen to remake the game? Maybe, maybe not. I   would rather have seen an HD remake or full remake of a classic than   simply a port to the latest console. Nevertheless, a port does increase   the nostalgia value of a game.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The older generation of gamers will be more inclined to buy and play Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Perhaps the somewhat younger Star Wars fans who are picking up this game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">And that&#39;s understandable since Jedi Outcast was known for having one of the best lightsaber mechanics of all Star Wars games.</font></font></p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast is a fun trip down memory lane. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The third person lightsaber fights are great and still one of the best of its kind. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The first person shooter part is to cry and especially with your Switch&#39;s gyroscope on. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If you turn it off, it&#39;s still doable. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The puzzles are fun and challenging and easy to solve with your force. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game is a port and that is clearly visible in the graphics. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">An HD remake or a full remake might have been nicer. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Jedi Outcast is particularly suitable for fans who want to take a trip down memory lane. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But also for the younger fans of Star Wars, this game is highly recommended.</font></font></p></div>
