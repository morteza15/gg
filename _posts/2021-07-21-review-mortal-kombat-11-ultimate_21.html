<div dir="ltr"><h4>Mortal Kombat 11 is the ultimate, definitive version of Mortal Kombat 11 and a more than fine and very complete ready-to-use Mortal Kombat to kick off next-gen. Super fast Fatality through the lightning fast SSD.</h4>  <p>Mortal Kombat 11 from NetherRealm Studios was released in early 2019 to great acclaim. Meanwhile, several expansions have appeared in the form of &#39;Kombat packs&#39; with new fighters and skins, as well as a story expansion in &#39;Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath&#39;. With Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate you immediately have the whole package complete.</p>  <h2>Lots of meat on the bone</h2>  <p>If you&#39;re looking for the next-gen fighter at the moment, Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate is just the thing for you. It doesn&#39;t matter if you have the Playstation 4 version of the base game, Aftermath expansion, or Ultimate version. You can upgrade all versions to the Playstation 5 versions free of charge. The Xbox version uses Smart Delivery, so you can easily switch to the improved version on Series X on Xbox.</p>  <p>You get right in with all 37 fighters, the complete story of Mortal Kombat 11 and a number of game modes, including multiplayer with cross-play functionalities. Mortal Kombat fans can indulge themselves in this complete version, because there is more than enough to do. But also for newcomers who are somewhat curious about this old franchise, or who want to come back after a few years, a warm welcome awaits.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ouch-scaled.jpg"></p>  <p>I myself am one of those people who, in the days of the original Playstation and Playstation 2, liked to work with Mortal Kombat and Tekken, among others. They were the multiplayer games to play on the couch with a friend. By hitting all the buttons on the controller at the same time, we sometimes performed the most brutal combos, purely by chance.</p>  <h2>What was that again?</h2>  <p>So don&#39;t be put off if you may have skipped 1, 2 or 3 generations of Mortal Kombat. Although the games have a story mode, which is nicely worked out in this part, it is of course not what this fighter needs. It&#39;s all about the brutal kombat, and it&#39;s triple present.</p>  <p>If you are not very familiar with this franchise or other fighting games, there is an extensive tutorial that you can follow in which the entire game is explained and you can get started with the different techniques. How do high and low attacks work? How do you use objects from the playing field to use for cruel actions? And how do you execute a sickening finisher that your opponent probably won&#39;t survive? It&#39;s all there and you can walk through it at your own pace. Then you can get started with the meat of the game.</p>  <img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mk11.jpg">  Here you come    <h2>There was once</h2>  <p>If you can&#39;t see the forest for the trees, just start with the story. Here you play different characters through different settings with different enemies. The story plays out a bit like a movie, with battles that you have to perform in between. The storytelling in this game is done really well. The scenes are nicely put together and the transitions to the fighting moments are almost seamlessly woven in between. Especially when you consider that it&#39;s really just a fighting game, it&#39;s very impressive what NetherRealm Studios has been able to do with the story.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scorpion.jpg"></p>  <p>The story itself, in itself, is not very memorable. And it all starts with a time-keeper and a time-paradox, which makes the whole plot run wild. It&#39;s kind of like a &#39;here we go again&#39; story. However, the presentation is top notch for this kind of game, which makes it entertaining to saunter through. Depending on how well you do in the end, there are a number of different endings. Although there is only one ending that the story of Aftermath builds on. You don&#39;t necessarily have to reach that end to play the expansion, it&#39;s just plot-technical.</p>  <h2>Round 1</h2>  <p>Of course, what it&#39;s all about in the game is fighting and performing the cruelest combos to literally and figuratively take out your opponent. The fighting in this game is very nice and smooth. It plays the way you would expect from a fighter on console in the most positive way you can name. Performing such combinations can be a bit tricky at times, but that&#39;s more my fault than the game.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mortal-kombat-robocop.jpg"></p>  <p>There are 37 different fighters and you can also change the fighters appearance with skins. Each fighter plays uniquely in its own way and all fan favorites are of course included here. Since we all know Mortal Kombat from the early days, certain action heroes from that time are also made available in Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate. For example, you play with the Terminator as Arny, with Rambo as Sylvester Stallone, RoboCop and even Joker from Batman!</p>  <p>This goes even deeper than just a few extra characters with familiar voice lines and familiar looks. They also interact with each other in a certain way. For example, I noticed that at the beginning of a round, Rambo and the Terminator had a small altercation. Small detail, but it enriches the experience a bit.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/koud-he-scaled.jpg"></p>  <h2>Verdict</h2>  <p>Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate is the next-gen fighting game right now. You&#39;re quickly in the action, it all looks gruesome and it plays nice and smooth. It is an overcomplete package with a lot of fighters to try and a great story mode to get started with to immerse yourself a little more in the characters and the overarching story. In the end it&#39;s all about a nice game of fighting and Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate offers you more than enough options.</p>  <div id="gmail-tap-translate">Â </div></div>
