<div dir="ltr"><h4>Dungeons and Dragons is an old well-known tabletop game in which players experience an adventure together. D&amp;D has always been a great source of inspiration for various RPG games and dungeon crawler games. In addition, D&amp;D has become more popular than ever in recent years. Partly due to Corona, the game has also taken off this year and received new players. The Dungeon of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet of Chaos is one such game inspired by D&amp;D.</h4>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Dungeon-of-Naheulbeuk-4.png"></p>  <p>The Dungeon of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet of Chaos is a third person dungeon crawler based on Dungeons and Dragons. But the makers have opted for a comedic twist for their game. The game is full of humor and standard prejudice. We see both the prejudices of people who don&#39;t play D&amp;D and the prejudices of the players in the game. The characters you control as a player have also all been given the default name of their class or race. The party adventurers consists of a Ranger, Elf, Dwarf, Barbarian, Orc, Thief and a Mage.</p>  <p>The company you go out with is constantly making fun of each other. This is how the insults go back and forth between the Elf and Dwarf. The Ranger pretends to be the leader and the bravest of the party, the Thief is an emo that is never listened to, the mage feels too good for the rest and the intelligence of the Orc and the Barbarian is hard to find. When you play D&amp;D and you get to work with The Dungeon of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet of Chaos, you will often have to laugh at the comments of your company. They are very recognizable from your own playing time in Dungeons and Dragons. Other characters you encounter in the game also meet the standard prejudices that exist regarding their class.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Dungeon-of-Naheulbeuk-1.png"></p>  <h3>Gameplay of The Dungeon of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet of Chaos</h3>  <p>As mentioned before, The Dungeon of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet of Chaos is a third person dungeon crawler. You can play the game with mouse and keyboard or with a controller. You often walk through the dungeon in which you encounter various encounters with known enemies from Dungeons and Dragons. Skeletons and goblins enough to defeat. When you encounter an encounter, you switch to a turn-based combat system. Behind the scenes an order is determined in which everyone takes a turn. Each character can do a walking action and an attack or defense action. You can also choose to walk twice instead of once. But unfortunately you can&#39;t attack twice in one turn.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Dungeon-of-Naheulbeuk.png"></p>  <p>In addition, you can also delay tactical use of your turn until a later turn in the same battle round. On the battlemap you can use various attributes behind which you can hide, making you harder to hit. But not every attribute is useful to sit behind since it also wanted to explode. Only thing I missed while playing The Dungeon of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet of Chaos is a skip or fast forward feature to speed up your opponent&#39;s actions. In some battles there are so many opponents in the game that it takes a few minutes before you are allowed to do something yourself.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Dungeon-of-Naheulbeuk-2.png"></p>  <p>Besides exploring and fighting you also have character sheets of your company on which you can make your characters stronger. After the battles, you earn XP that allows your characters to level up. In The Dungeon of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet of Chaos you will find plenty of items with which you can also make your characters stronger. All these items have a funny name. For example, the Dwarf starts with an ax called: Your First Lame-Ass Axe. The more items you find, the funnier some names become. In short, humor predominates in this game.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Dungeon-of-Naheulbeuk-3.png"></p>  <h3>Story and Verdict</h3>  <p>The story of The Dungeon of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet of Chaos is about a company in search of a statue. That statue has such a weird name that most of the characters in your party can&#39;t even pronounce it. At least they pronounce it wrong often enough. But along the way, they encounter The Amulet of Chaos. This amulet is cursed, so your characters will disappear from your company and become your enemy. Fortunately by dealing a few big blows they can come to their senses again. The company therefore looks for a solution to get rid of this amulet and to lift the curse.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Dungeon-of-Naheulbeuk-5.png"></p>  <p>The Dungeon of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet of Chaos is an entertaining dungeon crawler with a good dose of humor. Both the story and the gameplay are good and playable. Despite being steeped in comedic actions, conversations and items, the game continues to grab your attention. The battles are challenging where tactical play is key. Mindlessly entering battles the way your Orc and Barbarian would like is not one of them. What I did find annoying about the game is the lack of fast-forwarding or skipping your opponents&#39; turns. In big fights it just takes a little too long before you can do something again. The loading times of the game at startup are also just a bit on the long side. Nevertheless, it is a great game that Dungeons and Dragons continuously makes fun of the humor that is in the game.An entertaining game where you can laugh a lot and where you are challenged enough in the gameplay.</p>  <div id="gmail-tap-translate">Â </div></div>
