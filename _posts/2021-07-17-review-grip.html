<div dir="ltr"><h4 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:1.5rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Grip is a spiritual successor to the world famous Rollcage games. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">A racing game with cars that can drive on both sides. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The circuits are arranged in such a way that they can be played in 360 degrees. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Add some power ups and weapons for a violent racing game.</font></font></h4><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">A gamer&#39;s instinctual sense is very transparent. Once we see a ramp there is only one thing that goes through a gamer&#39;s mind. With Grip, however, it is sometimes advisable not to follow your instincts, but to play the game as your mother might. Now you may be wondering why I&#39;m saying this. That&#39;s how it is. Taking a ramp in Grip usually does not have the outcome you would like. Too little or too much speed can already put a spanner in the works. Your placement is also very important. This is not very easy when you are sweeping at speeds of 500 km per hour.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s not even the case that some dubious Frenchman is trying to drive you off the track, but more a matter of do I want to win, or do I want to be cool? </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The game offers you a lot of opportunities to show how cool you are, but usually this results in a negative outcome for your speed. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Even the slightest collision can put you from first place to last. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">I am also not entirely sure whether it is a matter of design or a lack of design. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Is being cool or winning a genuine choice in Grip or is something wrong? </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Some jobs offer you a lot of freedom. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Sometimes too much if you ask me. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Freedom is what limits you, although you wouldn&#39;t expect it.</font></font><br></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">360 Racing</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The great thing about Grip is that you can use the environment to your own liking. There are several routes and tracks you can take to race from start to finish as quickly as possible. Combined with unprecedented speeds and different power ups, each lap provides a new and surprising experience. You don&#39;t have to be an expert in racing games to have a chance at first place, because every mistake is severely punished in Grip. Blue Shells from Mario Kart are nothing compared to this.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">As I mentioned before, performing cool tricks is not always the solution if winning is your goal. It&#39;s always nice to just jump over this car instead of passing another car. Yes, this is a thing in this game. You can jump with your cars. This is also a way to turn back to the floor once you are riding on a ceiling. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">These are all super cool mechanics to experiment with, but the sky is not the limit in Grip. Literally. The game uses infamous invisible walls that will thwart your creative approach. In addition, there are strange glitches in certain points of the tracks that cause you to bump into an invisible obstacle.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">If the standard racing is just too much, the game offers all kinds of other modes that can be very entertaining. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">There are different racing modes, but also Arena modes where you have to demolish other cars. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">There is even a parkour mode called Carkour.</font></font><br></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Customization</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">It feels a bit like stepping back in time with the customization options of the vehicles. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">You can choose from different cars, although you must first have reached a certain level to unlock new options. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The same goes for the wheels and different sprays for your car. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Then you can provide everything with your favorite colors and you are ready to race. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Other players will see your own creations, although it can sometimes be a bit tricky to make up your mind when you&#39;re flying around the track at these speeds.</font></font></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">multiplayer</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Multiplayer is where Grip actually shines. At least it is, as long as you can find other players. In total I tried for about an hour to find other players, but I kept getting a message that no game was found and one would be created. Okay fine, then you spend 10 minutes in a lobby on your own before trying again to find new players. For example, I appeared several times in a lobby with only one person, coincidentally always the same one. My NAT type is set to 2, so it can&#39;t be my internet connection.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Maybe it&#39;s just that the game just came out, and there are still very few players on the Playstation 4, but in any case it&#39;s been damn hard to find other players to race with online. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">It doesn&#39;t really help that you can filter the races online by way, way too many criteria. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">However, once you find players, the racetrack is a mess. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">There are rockets flying past your ears, other cars crashing everywhere and you get the feeling that you are in an action movie. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The Drum &#39;n Bass music in the background completes the experience. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The Unsung Hero of this game: Splitscreen multiplayer. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">You can&#39;t claim to have made a spiritual successor of an old multiplayer focused game if it doesn&#39;t have split-screen in it. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Grip has it! </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">For no less than 4 people!</font></font><br></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Grip was a great idea with a &#39;meh&#39; execution. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This is mainly due to the technical defects of which you sometimes wonder whether it is intended that way, or whether it is a mistake. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">I would have liked to see more players to play the game with online, because this is what you really play the game for. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">However, once you find a game it is chaotically awesome and actually extremely challenging to win.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Grip easily ranks as one of the best arcade racers if it tackles its current problems well. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The game doesn&#39;t feel smooth enough yet and the current bugs in the game can cause you to lose your race in the last lap. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The idea of the game, with its mechanics, 360 circuits and power-ups, makes for brilliant competitions, if everything functions equally well.</font></font></p></div>
