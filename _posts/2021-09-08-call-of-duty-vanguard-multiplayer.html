<p>The single player mode of Call of Duty Vanguard has already been revealed.&nbsp;And last night was the multiplayer reveal.&nbsp;That way we know what the game will bring.&nbsp;And that's really a lot.&nbsp;It is high time for a comprehensive overview.&nbsp;These are the main points you need to know.</p><h2>Call of Duty Vanguard: The Multiplayer</h2><h3>20 maps</h3><p>One of the most interesting elements of Call of Duty Vanguard's multiplayer is that you can get started right away with a load of maps.&nbsp;At launch, there are no less than 20. And that's more than what the average game in the series starts with.&nbsp;Hopefully they will also be good maps and we might get to see a few classics from yesteryear.&nbsp;Anyway: it promises to be a great party in that area.</p><h3>Patrol as a new mode in Call of Duty Vanguard</h3><p>Often with a new Call of Duty game you get the opportunity to try a new mode.&nbsp;In Call of Duty Vanguard you will be introduced to Patrol.&nbsp;It is a mode somewhat reminiscent of Hardpoint.&nbsp;The difference seems to be that in Patrol you are dealing with a zone that moves.&nbsp;That way you have to constantly think about how you deal with the enemies.&nbsp;Hopefully it will be a keeper.</p><h3>Customize your weapon</h3><p>Of course it will be possible to customize your weapon in Call of Duty Vanguard.&nbsp;They choose to follow the success of the previous games and continue on that path.&nbsp;Per weapon you now have ten different attachments and adjustments that you can make.&nbsp;So that is two more and provides more possibilities.&nbsp;Furthermore, the Riot Shield returns (always useful as a second weapon to avoid getting shot in the back) and Akimbo returns with certain weapons. So it seems that there are more possibilities and you see certain elements.</p><figure style="text-align: center;" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_442301"><img title="Call of Duty Vanguard" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F09%2FCall-of-Duty-Vanguard-destructie.jpeg" alt="Call of Duty Vanguard" /><figcaption>Plenty of options to play with your weapons&nbsp;(Image: Activision)</figcaption></figure><h3>Three ways to play the game</h3><p>In the multiplayer mode of Call of Duty Vanguard, you have three ways to play the game.&nbsp;Those ways seem to be mainly linked to the amount of players you work with at the same time.&nbsp;Tactical is the name of the standard six against six mode, as you know the traditional multiplayer.&nbsp;Then you have Assault.&nbsp;This is a mode where you want to battle it out in a somewhat larger setting.&nbsp;In the beta you can expect games with 20 to 28 players in this mode.&nbsp;Finally, you have Blitz.&nbsp;This is when you really want to go wild with many players at the same time.&nbsp;Expect games with 28 to 48 players in the beta.&nbsp;So conviviality.</p><figure style="text-align: center;" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_442302"><img title="" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F09%2FCall-of-Duty-Vanguard-Hotel-Royal.jpeg" alt="Call of Duty Vanguard Hotel Royal" /><figcaption>Dissolve at Hotel Royal&nbsp;(Image: Activision)</figcaption></figure><h3>Play with the environment</h3><p>No, Call of Duty Vanguard won't go as far as Battlefield, but there is certainly room to take advantage of environments and partially demolish them as well.&nbsp;For example, you can demolish various woodwork to surprise the opponent in this way.&nbsp;For example, sprint through a wooden door and surprise the enemy.&nbsp;In addition, it is possible to mount your weapons on a barricade.&nbsp;That way you position yourself somewhat hidden, while at the same time you can shoot sharper.&nbsp;All this should ensure that you have just a little more opportunities to play tactically.</p><h3>Perks and Field Upgrades</h3><p>Perks will of course return in Call of Duty Vanguard.&nbsp;There are Operator Perks and Weapon Perks.&nbsp;Together they are called Proficinies.&nbsp;These give you advantages in terms of movement and the way you shoot.&nbsp;The game&nbsp;'s blog&nbsp;gives the example of the Lightweight Perk for fast running.&nbsp;And if you combine that with the Weapon Perk Gung-Ho you have the opportunity to pop while sprinting.&nbsp;That way you can enjoy the game again.</p><figure style="text-align: center;" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_442300"><img title="Call of Duty Vanguard map" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F09%2FCall-of-Duty-Vanguard-map.jpeg" alt="Call of Duty Vanguard map" /><figcaption>Calm before the storm&nbsp;(Image: Activision)</figcaption></figure><h3>This is when the beta starts</h3><p>If you are completely convinced of what Call of Duty Vanguard has to offer, it is possible to pre-order the game.&nbsp;Do you do that on the PlayStation?&nbsp;Then you can get started with the beta from September 10.&nbsp;This runs until September 13.&nbsp;If you don't want to pre-order it yet or are you playing on another platform?&nbsp;Then you can get started with the game between September 16 and 18.&nbsp;That beta immediately tests the crossplay possibility between the different platforms.</p><figure style="text-align: center;" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_442303"><img title="Call of Duty Vanguard" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F09%2FCall-of-Duty-Vanguard-beta-tijden.jpeg" alt="Call of Duty Vanguard" /><figcaption>This is when the beta kicks off&nbsp;(Image: Activision)</figcaption></figure><h3>And this is what's in it</h3><p>During the Call of Duty Vanguard beta you get a small taste of what will eventually be in it.&nbsp;There are three traditional multiplayer maps to get started with.&nbsp;These are Hotel Royal, Red Star and Gavutu.&nbsp;The big question of course is whether the maps are worth a bit.&nbsp;There are also a few new play modes.&nbsp;In addition to classics such as Domination, Team Death Match and Kill Confirmed, you can also check out whether the new Patrol is to your liking.&nbsp;Finally, you can also try Champion Hill if you missed it in the previous beta.</p>
