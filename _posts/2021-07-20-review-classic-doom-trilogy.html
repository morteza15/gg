<div dir="ltr"><div class="entry-content">            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The old DOOM games from the past are back on Playstation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Bethesda released them into the wide world during QuakeCon as a surprise. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">We were allowed to play them (again) for a while to pass judgment.</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If you&#39;ve already played the old titles, there&#39;s really nothing you don&#39;t know. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">They are the same old titles but fully supported on the last generation of consoles. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You also get almost all expansions. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Some exceptions to this rule are &#39;No rest for the living&#39; and the &#39;Final DOOM&#39; extensions. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">These are not included. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">DOOM 3 is based on the BFG edition and actually the most striking title of the three.</font></font></p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi/BQ3iqq49Ew8/maxresdefault.jpg"><br><br><p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><br></font></font></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">DOOM and DOOM II</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">These   oldies play surprisingly well with a Dualshock 4 controller. In fact,   you&#39;re almost done with it. Not because it&#39;s not fun, but because you   literally get through it in no time. The rise of the first person   shooter was huge and DOOM excelled in this. Everything was new,   mysterious and WOW! It depends on how you look at it, but the games   aren&#39;t exactly well-barred. Nostalgia gives me an angry look when I say   this, but fair is fair. This is also the reason why you completed DOOM   and DOOM II fairly quickly. You&#39;ve already mastered all the tricks and   mechanics of the first person shooter in recent years and since DOOM was   one of the founders, everything was fairly obvious compared to now.</font></font></p><p><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Coincidentally,   I recently played through DOOM 2016 all the way through, so the DOOM   way of secrets and level design are still fresh in my head. No doubt   this helped me get through the first two games in the trilogy, although   they were a bit more difficult due to the lack of all the modern gadgets   in modern video games. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Despite   you being done with it quickly, these two classics are highly   recommended for everyone. If you&#39;ve already played the games, it can&#39;t   hurt to pick up your nose with DOOM until Eternal comes out in November.   If for whatever reason you&#39;ve missed these two classics in your life,   there&#39;s all too much reason to pick them up.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Both   titles are offered for â‚¬4.99 in the respective digital stores for   Playstation, Xbox and Nintendo so for a few euros you have a few hours   of pure nostalgic entertainment. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If you&#39;ve already played them, try not to hum along to the tune from the first level. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Just give it a try. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Seems to be quite difficult.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">DOOM 3</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This   is where it gets really interesting. I must confess that I never played   through this title completely because I simply found it too scary at   the time. I didn&#39;t play FEAR either, but quietly watched a buddy of mine   play through the game with a beating heart. Now that I&#39;ve finally had   the chance to play through DOOM 3, I&#39;m finding out what an impact this   title has had on the sci-fi horror genre. Several times while playing I   felt like I was playing a prototype of Dead Space.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Obviously   with the first two games in mind, DOOM 3 was developed in a way that   can convey much more of the DOOM vibe. Although it seems that this was   not their original idea. DOOM 3 generally has a rather dark and exciting   vibe to it. The game wants you to feel a little uncomfortable. DOOM   2016 returns completely to the arcade form of DOOM without using any   form of narrow hallways and scares like we saw in DOOM 3. On the one   hand logical, since it is a DOOM reboot whose first game had a clear   arcade setting with many open areas.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">On the other hand, it&#39;s a bit of a shame. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Visceral   Studio&#39;s closure still hurts a bit, and Dead Space&#39;s success is partly   due to DOOM 3. They&#39;ve obviously capitalized on the many elements in   DOOM&#39;s third installment and managed to &#39;perfect&#39; them. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Something the game already manages to do better in part 3 has been recorded and further developed by other studios. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Personally, I wasn&#39;t a fan of the &#39;gotcha!&#39; in the first DOOM games. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">moments,   but in DOOM 3 these have already been improved a lot, actually seem a   lot more logical and add to the overall creepy atmosphere of the game.</font></font><br></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gotcha!</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The gotcha moments in these FPS titles are actually nothing less than triggers that cause enemy spawns. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   the classic DOOM games, these mainly occur when you pick up a certain   item or pass a certain tile that opens up walls around you (usually   behind you) with monsters attacking you. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   DOOM 3 this tradition is quietly continued, but this mechanism,   together with the monster closet or monster under your bed, fits much   better in the setting, making it much less disruptive in the end. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Many elements introduced by id Software have been further developed over the years. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In the video below you can clearly see what the influence of the franchise has brought to titles such as Dead Space.</font></font></p>            <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Either way, DOOM</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> is a franchise you can&#39;t get rid of. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That&#39;s a good thing, because it is the foundation of a lot of good that we can experience today. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Bethesda   and id Software want to emphasize this all too well and that is why you   are already provided with a digital collection of games with the   foundations of sci-fi, fps and even the sci-fi horror genre for two   bucks.</font></font></p>           </div></div>
