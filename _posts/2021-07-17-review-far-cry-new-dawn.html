With handles from Far Cry 5 I substantiate whether I like this game as much as the previous one. Read it all in my review, I'll try not to use spoilers (but be warned anyway)!</h4><p style="box-sizing: inherit; color: #404040; font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, Graphik, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 1.5em;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">Where most Far Cry games were a whole new story in itself, Far Cry New Dawn is a sequel to Far Cry 5. A new concept that I was very curious about when the game was teased.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">Asking if you still recognize it, are there any characters from Far Cry 5 present and how do I find my new place in the new Hope County?&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">Back to Montana to come to the rescue once again and hopefully free that one little spot from evil forever.</font></font></p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; color: #404040; font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, Graphik, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 1.5em;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;"></font></font></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;"><a href="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/leDOUm5yia4/maxresdefault.webp" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="450" data-original-width="800" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/leDOUm5yia4/maxresdefault.webp" /></a></font></font></div><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;"><br />&nbsp;</font></font><br /><p></p><h3 style="box-sizing: inherit; clear: both; color: #404040; font-family: &quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.2;"><span style="box-sizing: inherit; color: #ff7f00;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">graphics</font></font></span></h3><p style="box-sizing: inherit; color: #404040; font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, Graphik, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 1.5em;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">Far Cry New Dawn is built in the same engine as Far Cry five.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">A beautiful world with good details.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">Places that are too beautiful not to make a print screen or just to stand and look at the view.</font></font><br style="box-sizing: inherit;" /><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">The cutscenes are well done as always.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">The voices and characters are similar and make you feel like you're really part of the story.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">Still, sometimes the NPCs of Far Cry are a bit boring and monotonous.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">With many of the same NPCs being used over and over and having little to no dialogue between each other.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">For example in Skyrim where NPCs can have a whole conversation and where Far Cry NPCs talk about their anus itching.</font></font><br /></p><h3 style="box-sizing: inherit; clear: both; color: #404040; font-family: &quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.2;"><span style="box-sizing: inherit; color: #ff7f00;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">Gameplay</font></font></span></h3><p style="box-sizing: inherit; color: #404040; font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, Graphik, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 1.5em;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">The game starts with the choice of whether you want to play as a man or a woman. There is also an option to customize your character. It's very low key with some basic hairstyles and some face types. Nothing fancy or too flashy. Would I mind having a wider choice to really build my own character? Yes I think so, although you almost never get to see your own character. Still, I can certainly lose an hour on creating the perfect character. What's nice, beards also work on female characters!</font></font><br style="box-sizing: inherit;" /><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">Ubisoft has also tackled the combat system a bit.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">Where you normally just shot someone until he was down, enemies now have a health bar.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">You also see hit points when you hit someone.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">It takes some getting used to, but useful to quickly see which weapon is causing which damage without having to take a closer look at them in the store.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">You make your first weapon yourself from some stuff you find.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">And this is a cool weapon!&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">My tip, don't throw that thing away.</font></font></p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; color: #404040; font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, Graphik, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 1.5em;">Ubisoft is known for the well-known way of playing the game for the Far Cry series and also the Assassins Creed games. You have the same side missions every game as you unlock all camps. Some people don't like this, I've often heard that people find this work monotonous. I think this is always one of the nicest things to do. Find a nice point, grab your sniper and go with that banana. Run around the base for a bit so they don't see you and hoppa, unlocking another camp. I always try to do this as stealthily as possible for extra points and stuff. However, there is now something new in this system, you can liberate a camp and get all the stuff and give it back to the bad guys. These will take over the camp again, but this time with a little more man and power.This gives the player the option to take over the camp again with more effort but also a greater reward.</p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; color: #404040; font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, Graphik, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 1.5em;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">You also have your 'Guns for Hire', your storyline fellow NPCs and your animals as friends in battle.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">You start out with Carmina but soon get the option to swap with animals and other NPCs.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes handy, Carmina screams so much for nothing… Yet in the beginning it is useful to have someone who also has a firearm.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">And airdrops!&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">There are spontaneous airdrops!&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">With somewhat good loot.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">But it surprised me…</font></font><br style="box-sizing: inherit;" /></p><div class="gmail-wp-video" style="box-sizing: inherit; color: #404040; font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, Graphik, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 1200px;"></div><span face="&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif" style="color: #404040; font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;</span><br style="box-sizing: inherit; color: #404040; font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, Graphik, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;" /><font style="box-sizing: inherit; color: #404040; font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, Graphik, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">The menu of the game is the same as Far Cry 5.

But again you are back, this time as a different person but with the same mission. Get the bad people outta here. You travel the country with a crew to help Settlements now that America is completely in tatters. But the train is intercepted and almost everyone is killed by the new bad guys. Only a small group, including you, survives. Then you meet the new bad people who want to ruin the weather for the lucky people in Hope County. The twins Mickey and Lou. The Highwayman leaders. Two badass sisters who got wind of the peaceful existence in the new place. Do they have a mission? Not really, they just want to be in the place they've now taken over.After the intro you will enter the new Hope County. The whole world has changed after the bombs seventeen years ago. The world you see now is colorful, the animals evolved and the people happy with the new place (apart from the bad people). Many animals have changed a bit over time. It's the same wildlife as Far Cry 5 but now infected with some radioactive stuff. That means, for example, that bison's are now just medium-sized tanks that you really have to go around with a big (very big) arc. Because almost nothing can stop them. But when you travel further than around your Settlement you find out that not everything is so colorful and beautiful. A large area is still destroyed by the bombs. Blackened and very radioactive. A place where you can't walk as a noob player in the beginning.The whole world has changed after the bombs seventeen years ago.

Not because it's poorly conceived, but we've seen the story before. Where Far Cry 5 was a completely new concept with a religious cult, these Highwaymen are something we already know. An unhinged gang with no rules where one person (now two) stands out. The bad guys reminded me a lot of Far Cry 3. Where Vaas was way better than Mickey and Lou. So it feels a bit like a repetition to me. Fortunately, a very dangerous person comes around the corner from Far Cry 5, but I'm not going to talk about that. That's for you to find out!</font></font><br style="box-sizing: inherit;" /><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">Also I don't know if the trend of post apocalyptic games is so much fun every time.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">I've seen it again after Far Cry.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">Still, I'm going to lose all my time behind the PlayStation 4 with this game.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">I'm going to put as much time into it as all the previous ones and still enjoy the game and storyline.&nbsp;</font><font style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">I remain happy with the way of playing at Ubisoft games and will not change my mind about this anytime soon.</font></font></p></div>  <div id="tap-translate"></div><div id="tap-translate"></div><div id="tap-translate"></div>
