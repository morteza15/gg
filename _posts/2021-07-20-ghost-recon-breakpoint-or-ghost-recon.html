<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Ghost Recon Breakpoint, or Ghost Recon&#39;s Breaking Point? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That&#39;s today&#39;s key question and we&#39;re going to dig around the game to make a judgment. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Where Wildlands managed to bring in many players, but sometimes missed the essence of the Ghost principle. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">How does this look in the Ghost Recon that builds on the formula of the previous title.</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Ghost   Recon Breakpoint is very similar to its predecessor at its core. A big,   but really big open world filled with missions, side missions and all   kinds of other activities such as finding new weapons and parts. Where   Wildlands failed miserably on the stealth principle, Ubisoft seems to be   going double-down on this mechanic. As you would expect, this comes   with pros and cons. Where the stealth principle is very cool, it is not   essential. At least, to a certain extent.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The awkward thing about Ghost Recon Breakpoint is that the opening starts off very strong. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Narratively not so, but we will come back to that later. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Until you find the first hiding place, the game is quite linear. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">And this worked very well. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There were patrols that you had to take out where stealth is the best solution since you can&#39;t take that much in Ghost Recon. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There   was a certain tension and the road to your target was well set up with   hiding places, mud to camouflage yourself and the occasional building   you could enter to approach the enemy from a different angle. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A direct confrontation where stealth is not essential, but helps enormously. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   the rest of the game I missed this very much and it is almost not   recommended to use stealth because you simply don&#39;t need it.</font></font></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Every advantage has its disadvantage</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">While   playing Ghost Recon Breakpoint, there have been many moments where I   thought, Yes, this is cool! But very soon the other side of the same   coin appeared. So I gave the example of stealth. The large open world   and generally very spacious mission areas do not promote this gameplay   at all. Unless you&#39;re shooting everything with a sniper from an   elevation, there&#39;s little reason to use stealth. The AI is in fact   very stupid, so a direct confrontation is almost no risk. If you are   noticed and the hunt is open, all you have to do is sit on a staircase   and all the enemies will come in one by one, ready for execution. This   works much faster than very quietly trying to take out your opponents   without being noticed.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">During   the game you will also find new weapons and equipment with a certain   score. The score increases very slowly, so you keep changing your   weapons and equipment all the time. You basically don&#39;t notice this. At a   higher level, your gear will have secondary stats like extra stamina or   stealth, but otherwise it&#39;s just a number. However, you need these   numbers because later in the game enemies are a higher level and you   need equipment with a higher level. Very strange because you don&#39;t   notice your equipment at all until you get to this point where you do no   damage or almost no damage because the enemy requires higher gear,   apparently.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The story also seems to be quite interesting. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A defecting soldier. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">What has led to this situation? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">What does Skell Technology have to do with it? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Lots of questions in an interesting setting. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Unfortunately,   the story is quite difficult to follow due to a lot of uninteresting   and bad cutscenes with a lot of posturing and technical limitations such   as truncation of sentences or the complete lack of sound. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Pity.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Strange choices</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Where   the general gameplay loop in itself is very entertaining, you keep   questioning everywhere while playing. Everything in the big world is   very far from each other so that you don&#39;t think for a moment let me   grab the motorcycle or something. The only vehicle I scour the world   with is the helicopter and as long as you don&#39;t park your heli 5 meters   away from an enemy, nobody has a clue that you are nearby. It just feels   like you&#39;re playing a game that was put together by different sub-teams   where communication was forbidden.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   world is quite beautiful from a distance and in general it all looks   slick if you don&#39;t look too close at the rather blurry textures. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Faces and animations in cutscenes are not very good. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Only the scenes where Jon Bernthal is in the picture are quite okay. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Compared to previous Ubisoft titles, however, it is seriously below par. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In addition, this game also suffers from immense texture pop-in on the Playstation 4 Pro. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Perhaps   even worse than The Division 2 because at many moments the enemies   literally spawn next to you while you&#39;ve been roaming around the   location for a good minute. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">At one point I had to follow a truck, but the truck was invisible. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The objective marker moved across the street, but there was no sign of a truck. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Suddenly it appeared out of nowhere.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Ghost Recon Breakpoint wants to continue embroidering on </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Wildlands</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">   but fixes things that aren&#39;t broken. Tries to overcompensate for   previously missed features to the annoyance (I&#39;m looking at you, recon   drone). The game was unveiled with great fanfare. Jon Bernthal is in the   game and all different </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">irrelevant rappers are trying to promote the game through different videos</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> . Now it is also clear where the bulk of the budget has been invested.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Playing Breakpoint makes me long for an old-fashioned Ghost Recon or even Splinter Cell title. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Not every game has to be as big as Odyssey. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Not every game needs that much loot. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Just because it works for Assassin&#39;s Creed doesn&#39;t mean it works for Ghost Recon. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The gameplay loop is okay, but everything around it falls very short. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Very surprising as Wildlands has laid a great foundation for the Open World Ghost Recon Reboot.</font></font></p></div>
