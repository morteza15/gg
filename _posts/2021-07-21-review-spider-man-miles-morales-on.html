<div dir="ltr"><h4>The Playstation 5 is here and Sony is opening up next-gen with nothing less than a sequel to 2018&#39;s Spider-Man. A new game, a new Spider-Man. New dangers, new powers and new features. Miles Morales has it all.</h4>  <p>Deja Vu? That could be! We&#39;ve covered Spider-Man: Miles Morales before in our Playstation 4 review . This time we look purely at the game on Playstation 5. Despite the game being available on both platforms, the game was developed with the Playstation 5 as a starting point. It&#39;s not just another next-gen upgrade with the addition of Raytracing. The game looks breathtaking and also plays very well.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MSM_MilesMorales_PS5_Harlem.png"></p>  <h2>Miles Morales</h2>  <p>We&#39;ve already talked about Miles in the Playstation 4 review, but just briefly what Miles brings to the table in this new Spider-Man game. If you have played Spider-Man 2018, you will soon notice a number of differences when playing this new game. Miles Morales has a few extra powers that he can use. We don&#39;t see the strong attacks on cooldown from Peter Parker such as web blossom with Miles. In contrast, this young Spider-Man has the powers of bioelectricity. It&#39;s called &#39;Venom&#39; in this game, but don&#39;t confuse it with the Venom. In addition, Miles Morales can temporarily become invisible to re-enter a stealth mode.</p>  <p>Despite the many similarities between the two superheroes, Miles plays very differently from his great example. Finer even. The new moves add new interesting ways to engage in combat. The Venom attacks feel very powerful. Anyway, so far you could already experience this on the Playstation 4. What makes this game really next-gen?</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MSM_MilesMorales_PS5_2020Suit.png"></p>  <h2>Miles Morales on Playstation 5</h2>  <p>Spider-Man: Miles Morales on Playstation 5 can be played in two ways. Fidelity and Performance. For this review I completed the game the first time in Fidelity mode and the second time on New Game+ in Performance mode. How do these versions differ from each other?</p>  <p>The big difference is that the Fidelity mode uses Raytracing. Reflections in shiny objects are therefore real-time and very realistic. It helps a lot that the whole game is one big mirror palace. All of New York is filled with high-rise buildings with polished windows that you can see yourself into and keep an eye on the whole world behind you simply by looking into the mirror image. We can also quickly close the &#39; puddlegate &#39; discussion because there are a lot of puddles of water on the street that reflect everything realistically and this actually makes the difference between the two modes.</p>  <p>What is missing in the Performance mode is the Raytracing. For the rest, the game still looks breathtaking, but you do play in 60 FPS. The game is very smooth and plays wonderfully in this mode. Undoubtedly the smoothest mode to play, but even in 30 FPS the game just plays nice and smooth. You notice the difference very well.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/495115ee2ab8dadcc91.71926281-MilesMorales_Venom_PS5_Legal.png"></p>  <h2>What a puddle of water can loosen</h2>  <p>Yes, let&#39;s bring the discussion back to life. Remember when Spider-Man was under fire because fans thought the water puddles were geeky? Of course that blew up into one big meme, but those puddles of water really make a big difference I can tell you. The big difference between the Fidelity mode and the Performance mode is not so much the reflections in the buildings, but the reflections in the pools of water.</p>  <p>The buildings also reflect in performance mode, although these are &#39;fake&#39; reflections, you don&#39;t notice this very much when swinging. The puddles of water, on the other hand. You see them reflect very well in the Raytracing mode. It adds an awful lot of depth and detail to the streets of New York. While most of that detail and depth is lost in performance mode. It&#39;s far from distracting, but it&#39;s a great example of the impact Raytracing can provide in games.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MSMMM_Review_TimesSquare.png"></p>  <h2>My Spidey Senses are tingling!</h2>  <p>Something that the Playstation 5 also does very well in this game is 3D audio. As you meander through New York, you can literally hear the cars buzzing past you if you swing low enough over the streets. Projectiles like rockets can be heard flying past you if you dodge them and in general the direction of the sound is just very accurate. It is remarkable how much difference the 3D audio technology makes during gameplay. In many cases you can rely on the sound to perform a certain action. You just know when something is behind you.</p>  <p>What I was hoping for a little more was the extent to which the DualSense is used. The haptic feedback is used at some moments, especially at cinematic moments, to simulate the quake of a moving tram, for example, and this is very cool. It is unfortunately not used that much. While swinging you don&#39;t notice it so much, while it could really come into its own here. Let us feel the tension of the web as we swing at it. Perhaps Astro&#39;s Playroom has spoiled me too much in terms of haptic feedback.</p>  <p>To stay with the controller for a while, the extent to which the triggers are discussed is also quite limited. When swinging, you notice that a little force is put on it to offer resistance, but that&#39;s about it.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MSM_MilesMorales_PS5_TRACK_Suit.png"></p>  <h2>Verdict</h2>  <p>Spider-Man: Miles Morales is undoubtedly a no-brainer for anyone who manages to get their hands on the Playstation 5. It&#39;s a brilliant showcase of the new features and next-gen in general. The difference between the Playstation 4 and Playstation 5 version is night and day. Much more detail in everything around you and the streets of New York feel very lively with lots of traffic and very, very many people on the streets. There are virtually no loading times. The game boots up in less than 10 seconds and fast-travel happens in a split second.</p>  <p>Yes, the game is very short. It takes about 12 hours to do everything, add 2.5 hours for New Game+ and you&#39;ll hear your well-deserved *Pling* for the Platinum Trophy.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/miles-morals-plat-scaled.jpg"></p>  <div id="gmail-tap-translate">Â </div></div>
