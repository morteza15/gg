<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   a universe where No Man&#39;s Sky defines a new genre, we dive into another   spaceship to make space a lot safer for ourselves, especially   ourselves. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Subdivision Infinity DX tells the story of a &#39;Rebel Scum&#39; in space in search of more resources.</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">No   Man&#39;s Sky vibes from the first minute, but not exactly on a positive   note. The game feels quite empty, illogical at many moments and overall   everything hangs together in a silken thread. Despite my many criticisms   of Subdivision Infinity DX, the game shines at moments and can be quite   an entertaining arcade space shooter.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">When   I say No Man&#39;s Sky vibes I mean a big void with little &#39;content&#39;. This   is exactly what Subdivision Infinity DX also reflects. A large open   space in which the lack of relevant content is filled by the mining of   asteroids. You play through five chapters, each with five missions and   two exploration missions. These exploration missions send you back to   the space section of the respective chapter and let you search for   chests. These chests are hidden in large asteroids, or space stations.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The strange thing about these missions is that they could have been integrated very easily into the main missions. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Side-track for a while to look for boxes that allow you to build new ships. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It could even have been that each chapter was just one mission, with different chapters and exploration. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">During   a certain mission you play with certain checkpoints and waypoints so   the structure is already used, but on a very small scale that doesn&#39;t   really make sense. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">After all, you play every chapter in the same part of the room.</font></font><br></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Potency</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   may already notice it from the tone of my intro, but there is a lot of   potential in this game. A space to discover with a common thread where   you as a player are &#39;free&#39; to explore per chapter. You may be missing an   inventory management system in-game. You can only do this in the menu   where you actually return to your space station. This too could have   seen a traveling station where you could fly directly from the game   world. You only have limited cargo space on your ship. After mining some   asteroids you will need to go back to the main menu through a portal to   empty your cargo before you can continue playing.</font></font><br> Â <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Especially   in a game where you are constantly in space, swallowed by the   environment and often completely lose your sense of direction, the   structure of missions in this game completely breaks the depth. That&#39;s a   shame because even while playing the fairly short story missions you   will be removed from the mission after one or two fairly simple   assignments, after which you can start the next mission. It also doesn&#39;t   help that the game doesn&#39;t have any voices, but gameplay interrupts   text fields with pretty uninteresting conversations.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The result of this carelessly devised level design is a rather superficial experience. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   will start a mission, do a few simple actions such as shooting a cargo   ship and some enemy fighters and start a new mission from the main menu.   </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Continuous draft interrupting by returning to the main menu after a few minutes of action.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">So it is possible</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Subdivision Infinity DX is not a bad idea. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   game in an arcade form with perhaps a more free mission structure in a   space region where discovery is rewarded would work very well. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">While   playing I started to realize more and more that putting a player in a   large open space and taking it out after a few minutes doesn&#39;t work. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Once you&#39;re working on the slightly longer missions, it actually gets interesting. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You are immersed in the action and the environment. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Unfortunately, these moments often do not last long and the action is quickly interrupted again.</font></font></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">having said that</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If   the systems in the game were more integrated with the playing   environment, including missions that you could activate from space, this   game would have been very entertaining. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game looks very nice at certain times with the planets and different lighting effects in the background. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">During the battles you also get completely absorbed in the action. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s just such a shame that you&#39;re taken out so quickly when there&#39;s really no good reason for it.</font></font><br> <br></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For the hunters</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Whether you&#39;re chasing enemy ships or getting extra iron for your new ship, you&#39;ll at least be chasing trophies. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It is undoubtedly a short game meant for the trophy hunters among us. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Within a few hours you will have a platinum trophy by doing nothing more than completing the game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You will unlock most trophies automatically. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If   you do all the exploration missions and find all the chests you will   get almost all the trophies in a single sprint if you keep buying your   weapons properly. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Finding the boxes is very easy. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can purchase scanners from the in-game store that will display the chests in your HUD.</font></font></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Subdivision Infinity DX is a game with a lot of potential. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Especially   in the arcade scene, this game could go far by not taking itself too   seriously and putting more challenge and depth into the game that the   player could have immersed in without too many limits. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Unfortunately,   this does not apply to the game and the player is left with a   superficial experience where continuous action lasts no more than 5 to   10 minutes. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game lasts about 6 hours and with that you have earned a platinum trophy. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Considering   the price, not terribly bad, although I think quite a lot of   low-hanging fruit was not picked during the development of this game. </font></font></p></div>
