<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit" class="gmail-">Stadia   recently appeared for all Founders and with that, Google is entering   the video game industry with a platform where players can only stream   games à la Netflix and Spotify for movies and music. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However, it works slightly differently than mentioned all-in subscription services.</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">With   Stadia, Google makes having a powerful PC or a game console completely   unnecessary. At least that&#39;s the goal. With Stadia, players would be   able to play the latest games on TV, tablet, phone and PC or laptop. As   players you don&#39;t need a Playstation, Xbox or i7 for this. All games are   projected to your screen, so you don&#39;t run them locally on your own   equipment. Just like Netflix.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However,   the services are not completely comparable, where with Netflix you get   access to all content within the service for a fixed monthly fee, the   same does not apply to Google Stadia. Stadia is only the platform to   which one has access, the content must be obtained separately. Access to   Stadia is currently only possible with a Pro subscription through the   Founders Edition. A free version of the service will also be released   next year. You cannot receive 4K image quality and no surround sound via   the free version. Via the Pro subscription, yes. Pro players also   receive an occasional free game and a discount in the Stadia store for   digital games. Samurai Shodown and Destiny 2: The Collection are   currently free to claim for Pro subscribers.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Not without some commotion, the service finally appeared. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Does Google know to keep the promises made during the unveiling? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You probably already know the answer, but we have also looked at it with a critical eye.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Hit and miss experience</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">As   I mentioned earlier, it is possible to play on different screens via   Stadia. Since Google&#39;s Pixel is the only smartphone that is currently   supported and there is no tablet support yet, we have not tested it. We   did play Stadia on TV via the included Chromecast Ultra and Stadia   Controller. In addition, we also tested the service on PC via Ethernet   and Surface Pro 4 via WiFi. The results are remarkable. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   experience was not optimal via the Surface Pro 4 on a WiFi connection   with 200 mb/s download speed. From delay in the image to input delay,   grainy image and losing connection. You can choose via the settings to   put image or connection first, but this also hardly changed the   experience.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Things   got a lot better as soon as we tried to play with the TV in game mode   via a Chromecast Ultra and Stadia Controller. This minimizes input delay   at the expense of image quality. Since I have this setting on by   default for both the PS4 and Nintendo Switch, I have a good idea of   what to expect. The image quality of Stadia this way was okay. Not   great, but not terribly bad either. In any case, far from what Google   has shown before.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   biggest problem was not the picture, but more the sound and the input   delay. The sound lagged about half a second. In Destiny you didn&#39;t hear   the shots until after you started firing and in Tomb Raider it was a bit   more annoying as the voices didn&#39;t match the moving lips of the   characters. The input delay was a lot less remarkable with Tomb Raider   than with Destiny. I would like to know how this works with a racing   game, for that we come to another problem, which I will come back to in a   moment.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The best experience we have had with Stadia was via a PC in the Chrome web browser via an Ethernet connection. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Minimal input delay and again okay image quality. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I&#39;ve   spent a lot of time in Bungie&#39;s shooter over the past few weeks so I   had plenty of Destiny 2 comparison material as I play on both PC and PS4   thanks to the cross-save feature.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Local or streaming?</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The key question. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Many believe streaming is the future. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Also   in the field of games, Google is already trying to take a big step   here, but at the same time shows that it is not there yet. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">According to Google, it should all be cake and egg, but promised features are missing. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">No 4k at 60fps and Destiny 2 doesn&#39;t even run on high settings, but on medium. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That powerful cloud in the sky is still not as powerful as the PC under the desk, or the console under the TV. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It does help a bit when loading the titles. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Here we see the benefits of games that don&#39;t run locally, but somewhere in a server cabinet with powerful machines. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">We briefly compared the loading times of Destiny 2. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">From Orbit to the Moon, these are the times you can expect:</font></font></p>            <ul><li><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Playstation 4 Pro (HDD) – 55 seconds</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">PC (Ultra settings – HDD) 41 seconds</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Google Stadia – 25 seconds</font></font></li></ul>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The next issue we run into is the way games are priced in Stadia. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Despite Pro subscribers getting a discount, certain prices are astronomically high. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">GRID, for example, is offered for €69.99. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   can easily get this game for two tens less for your Playstation or Xbox   and this actually applies to the entire offer on Stadia at the moment. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Even after the addition of the launch titles, that offer is still on the very low side.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Stadia is a solution to a non-existent problem. Moreover, the solution is incomplete and deficient in many areas. </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Promised achievements are not delivered</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> , </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">a meager offer</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">   , a messy platform to navigate and so on. You could say that the   service &#39;works&#39;. The primary function works. You can stream games, but   it is far from an optimal experience and in this way gaming does leave a   sour taste. Google chased Stadia out the door and this was way, way too   soon. Developers haven&#39;t had enough time to serve their content through   Stadia, or </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">to adapt it to Stadia</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> . In addition, such simple functions (sharing and saving screenshots?) are missing, so that I</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> big question marks behind the future of Stadia</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> .</font></font></p></div>
