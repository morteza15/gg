<div dir="ltr"><h4><strong>Our swinging neighborhood hero goes on vacation and it&#39;s up to Miles Morales to keep a close eye on the city. Will our learning Miles succeed? Will you enjoy taking on this task in this standalone DLC? Read it in our review!</strong></h4>  <h6><strong>Spider-Man: Miles Morales is of course a Playstation 5 launch game. However, this console is not yet available in Europe, but the game is! So we were allowed to review it a little earlier from Sony, but then on the current line of consoles! That doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re leaving the PS5 version alone! Expect a next-gen review of the game next weekend, where we&#39;ll delve deeper into the Dualsense implementation, performance, graphics and loading times!</strong></h6>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/50350109341_3ac6962e00_h.jpg"></p>  <h5><strong>Paid leave</strong></h5>  <p>Peter Parker now knows that Miles had a spider bite and some time has passed since the base game. Miles wants to prove and improve herself. He can make good use of that opportunity, since Peter and MJ are going on holiday to Europe. Miles is an interestingcharacter, who isn&#39;t as deep as Peter, partly due to time and partly for some other reason. That reason is that Peter mainly strengthens himself in his character. Miles has a very strong cast of characters around him, stronger than Mr. Parker&#39;s in my opinion. This also ensures that Miles&#39;s story is told in a different way than that of the base game. The game takes place around Christmas anyway, yes you have already won me over. Some of the revelations came very quickly, as the game only has a story of about 8 hours. I like that length itself, although it does make the price of the game on the high side. The story is also told more than fine, as you would expect from first party games. The voice acting may not always be strong, especially from Miles,but then I&#39;m really nitpicking. Cutscenes, however, feel much more cinematic than in the base game, something I really liked and noticed from the first mission.</p>  <p>The crimes you had in Spider-Man are still there. This time, however, you can find them in two ways. You can still just swing by and complete them that way. But, you can also find them via the app. This also applies to side quests! This is a small improvement over before. The same goes for finding collectibles. You no longer have to constantly open your folder for this. You just press your right stick and you see the icons in the open world. This is much better than constantly hanging in the menus to set routes to your next collectible. These are the small quality changes that make the game feel a little newer.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/50350109441_df6e9dcda6_h.jpg"></p>  <h5><strong>By Thor&#39;s Hammer?!</strong></h5>  <p>Miles is a fairly athletic type, who in my opinion has a much nicer movement than Peter. He swings and fights completely different in style and actually got my preference quickly. He&#39;s more urban and has a bit of that flamboyant way of moving. For example, doing somersaults with him is a much fatter experience than with Peter. But, this is pretty opinionated. I also hear other sounds from people who found Peter much more enjoyable to play. Morales has a preference for electrical attacks, which can shock people as well as give a good punch to the gaff. His attacks have a little more &#39;punch&#39; than I am used to from Peter, who moves very quickly and fluently. You do notice that Miles still has a lot to learn and you go through that entire process with him, which made the experience all the more fun.Throwing a finisher every 15 attacks, followed by a Venom Punch just feels good, so I don&#39;t have much to complain about here. Miles&#39; suits and gadgets are also very cool. It feels a bit like your standard anime at times, where the protagonist gets into a mess and then learns new attacks. This way Miles will also be able to go invisible after a while. His powers are very versatile and this makes him a worthy spider mister. Puzzles are also fun, where Miles can easily apply as an electrician. All in all, it seems that Miles just has much better interactions with his environment. His bond with the people in the city also feels much more intimate. This is also due to the strong cast around him.Miles&#39; suits and gadgets are also very cool.

Well, actually graphically almost the same as the old game. Where the improvements are mainly in the details. Things hanging on walls, in shops or on tables have much more depth and detail. Car headlights have better illumination. The color range also seems slightly improved. But, these are all details that you only really notice when you start paying attention. I do think that Miles Morales has a much more intimate way of using the camera than the old game. However, the graphics quality will show up best in our next-gen review, due sometime this weekend! But, the game looks more than fine on the Playstation 4. The same goes for performance. Except for some small dips with a lot of particles in the air,I didn&#39;t notice anything that made me think &#39;this is really not possible&#39;. There were some nice bugs here and there, which you&#39;ve probably seen going around. In my game, Miles&#39; mom&#39;s smartphone was a pretty cool experience as it started flying around her face when she was on a phone call. There were also bugs that turned Miles into a lamppost or trash can. These little bugs are especially good for the laughter, shall we say. The menus are a bit simpler and above all quite aesthetically pleasing compared to before. You can equip Miles with new suits, gadgets and skills in these menus. They are a bit more sparse than the original menus, but they are therefore clearer.In my game, Miles&#39; mom&#39;s smartphone was a pretty cool experience as it started flying around her face when she was on a phone call.

I totally agree with the style Miles Morales got in the game. Too bad about the Adidas shoes, I would rather have seen Nike. But, the soundtrack that you often hear just fits the entire atmosphere impression that Insomniac wants to create. In fact, I would have liked to hear more soundtracks in the game, as the quality of these was very high.</p>  <h5><strong>Verdict</strong></h5>  <p>Miles Morales is not a perfect game, but it is the perfect launch title. His storyline is strong, his character is well developed and the entire atmosphere impression fits Morales perfectly. Apart from some minor flaws, this is a wonderful game to end your PS4 era with, or to start the new era. We&#39;ll dig deeper into next-gen performance in our PS5 review of the game!
