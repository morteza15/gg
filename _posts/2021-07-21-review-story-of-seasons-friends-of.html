<div dir="ltr"><h4>Farming games come in all shapes and sizes. You have Harvest Moon, Farming Simulator, Stardew Valley and League of Legends. But there is also Story of Seasons, the successor to the earlier Harvest Moon series. The new Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town will be released this Friday. However, we have been able to play the game for a few weeks and today we tell you what to expect in this new Farming game.</h4>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FOMT_SS_AutumnHill_EN.png"></p>  <p>Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town is a farming game in a more cartoon/anime style. Where, for example, Farming Simulator goes more for realism, we see more fantasy and faster gameplay in this game. In addition, Story of Seasons offers more space for some RPG elements and you can work on friendships with the locals. This makes the game more accessible to younger audiences who would rather see the fruits of their labor quickly than endlessly plowing many acres of land on a tractor. Story of Seasons doesn&#39;t focus entirely on running your farm, but encourages you to do other things in the game as well.</p>  <h3>The Farm Life of Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town</h3>  <p>The main goal in Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town is, of course, to run your own farm. The well-known story of your character who comes to his grandfather&#39;s farm as a child is well known. Many of these farming games start with a story like that, where you take over the farm from your deceased grandfather. Similarly in Story of Seasons, we see the intro taking the player to the farm of his or her deceased grandfather. Arrived at the farm it is in a dilapidated state. After you meet the mayor of the village. The old mayor knows a thing or two about running a farm and will explain a few things to you. After that you have been reminded to make something of it.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FOMT_SS_Mayo_EN.png"></p>  <p>After the explanation of the mayor you can start removing the naturalization on your land. With the tools you get you can work the land and then plant your first crops. With your small starting capital, you buy the seeds and plant them on your farm. You have to take into account your calendar and what type of crops you buy. With the calendar you can keep track of how long you have left in the current season. You have four seasons a year in which you can grow various types of crops. You can then divide these crops into a single harvest and a continuous harvest. One-time crops are crops that you plant and harvest and then you have to replant them. Continuous crops are crops that you plant once a season and continue to grow and yield a harvest.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FOMT_SS_GoodEgg_EN.png"></p>  <p>But you can do even more on your farm in Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town. You can also take care of various animals on your farm. For example, you can take care of chickens, cows and horses on your farm. You have to make sure that you have enough food or that you take them outside every day. You can also talk to your animals and you can even brush the larger animals. You do all this to get healthy and happy animals that then leave behind products to sell. Chickens that lay eggs and from the cow you get milk. The better you take care of them, the better your product will be and therefore more profitable when you sell it.</p>  <h3>Life outside your farm</h3>  <p>There are many other things you can do outside of your farm in Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town. Nearby there is a river, a lake and a sea where you can fish. You can sell or release these fish in your own lake on your farm. In a nearby cave you can go on an expedition to dig up minerals. You need these minerals to improve your tools. With the found minerals and money you can improve your tools at the local blacksmith. With this you can run your farm even faster and easier and plant and harvest even more crops.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FOMT_SS_Brandon_EN.png"></p>  <p>In the village where you will find a shop to buy your seeds and the blacksmith where you can improve your tools, you can make friends with the entire population. In fact, you can start a relationship with some residents and even marry them. Each resident has their own story within the village that you can explore by befriending them. You can make friends with the residents by talking to them regularly, or every day, and by giving them gifts. Various events also take place in the village during the year. Here you can often win nice prizes for your farm or with which you can improve yourself.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FOMT_SS_Doctor_EN.png"></p>  <p>In the village you will also find a number of small dwarfs with whom you can also become friends. These dwarfs are useful for your farm. If they are your friends you can ask them to help with all the tasks on your farm. You can also play mini games with them. The more you play with them, the better they get at helping out on your farm. Later on when you have a lot of work to do on your farm, these little guys are really handy to use.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FOMT_SS_SpritesFlower_EN.png"></p>  <h3>Verdict</h3>  <p>Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town is another fun and fun farming game. The cheerful anime style ensures that the game can appeal to multiple target groups. Accompanied by cheerful pieces of music, you can work in a zen way on your own farm and make friends with the locals. If you&#39;re a little tired of your farm, there&#39;s still plenty to add to it. Exploring the cave, fishing, building relationships and attending events are all possible. Train the little dwarfs and you can ask them to run your entire farm while you cast your rod at a lake. In short, a fun and cozy farming game for the whole family.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FOMT_SS_Holiday_EN.png"></p>  <div id="gmail-tap-translate">Â </div></div>
