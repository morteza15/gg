<div dir="ltr"><h4><span style="vertical-align:inherit">2K and Hangar 13 surprised the gaming world not so long ago with a </span><span style="vertical-align:inherit">short teaser</span><span style="vertical-align:inherit"> for a </span><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Mafia trilogy</span><span style="vertical-align:inherit"> . There were already rumors about a remaster of Mafia 2. These turned out to be true, but there was so much more to come. We have at least been able to take a closer look at the rumor-ridden remaster of Mafia 2.</span></h4>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">A so-called &#39;shadowdrop&#39; and Mafia 2 Definitive Edition and Mafia 3 Definitive Edition appeared on digital shelves May 19. But where is the original Mafia game then? Well, it&#39;s not coming until August, because that game is getting the full remake treatment and spoiler alert, </span><span style="vertical-align:inherit">it&#39;s looking great so far</span><span style="vertical-align:inherit"> ! Yet we are a bit worried about the remake that is coming our way in a few months. Mainly because of the just released polish of Mafia 2.</span></p>  <p><img class="gmail-alignnone gmail-wp-image-60461 gmail-size-full" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Mafia-2-DE-winter.jpg" alt="Mafia 2 DE Winter" width="1920" height="1080"></p>  <h2><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Fork over the Dough</span></h2>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Mafia 2 was released 10 years ago for Playstation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows PC. The game was extremely strong and forward-looking for its time. The game world felt very lively, looked great and had a catchy, naughty vibe. The world you played in changed a number of times, giving you a good sense of the speed at which the industrial revolution was moving. The entire development of America, the trends and the underground world that the story deals with painted a nice picture of the design at the time, if only a fictitious play on reality.</span></p>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">A diverse game with many interests and many groups that have to find something to do. This is another very prominent theme in Mafia 2 that America still struggles with today. The Italian Mafia is one of these groups and you as Vito Scaletta are part of it. In a period when you could buy a bottle of Coca Cola for less than 15 Dollar cents, the green bill was already a sign of status and success, but the fast road to a lot of greenery does not come without the necessary dangers.</span></p>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Vito Scaletta knows better than anyone how walking this road can turn like a cold dish in the afternoon sun. From unlimited souvlaki with two rompers on your lap to Rhodes on the gyros in a matter of seconds.</span></p>  <p><img class="gmail-alignnone gmail-wp-image-60460 gmail-size-full" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Mafia-2-shootout.jpg" alt="mafia 2" width="1920" height="1080"></p>  <h2><span style="vertical-align:inherit">With your cat in the Playboy</span></h2>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">No doubt you&#39;ve played Mafia 2 in the past 10 years, but if not, you&#39;ve got another chance to take your shot at the last minute of this generation. You get a very unique open-world experience in return with a slightly outdated playstyle and design, but it all comes with its charms. Many of those charms are scattered around the gaming world in the popular Playboy magazines. But also in general the game still plays fine after 10 years, although it takes some getting used to and frustration.</span></p>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Remarkable about the remaster is that the game hasn&#39;t changed much compared to 10 years ago. Certain assets have been given a nice facelift and the many key characters in the game look considerably better than 10 years ago. This cannot be said about the whole picture and therefore you will be faced with a dubious presentation. On the one hand, the game looks pretty good in the low twilight sun, on the other hand you see how dated the game actually is. In addition, many beauty flaws, clipping and glitches also come into play. Fortunately, the Playboy magazines look beautiful, so the necessary resources have been carefully distributed.</span></p>  <p><img class="gmail-alignnone gmail-wp-image-60464 gmail-size-full" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Vito.jpg" alt="Vito" width="1920" height="1080"></p>  <h2><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Nice when it works</span></h2>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">To sum up, Mafia 2 Definitive Edition plays very well if all goes well. Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t work very often and that&#39;s why I&#39;m a bit worried about the Mafia Remake.</span></p>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Mafia 2 Definitive Edition is full to the brim with framerate issues and input lag. It is even so bad that you automatically take it into account while playing. You calculate the deceleration and the frame dips when driving and make sure that you have not pressed full throttle in narrow places because the precision that you normally have is difficult to perform here, taking into account the above problems. Also during firefights I mainly lean towards a weapon where precision doesn&#39;t play a big role because the game technically lets me down.</span></p>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">You would expect a game from 10 years ago to come into its own with a little polish, but unfortunately. Several times I have wondered how this remaster got through the QA phase. The amount of texture pop-in is also an eyesore and it doesn&#39;t require much effort or attention to notice. It happens several meters in front of you and is most noticeable in shadows and natural greenery.</span></p>  <p><a href="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/M2DE.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="gmail-alignnone gmail-wp-image-60462 gmail-size-full" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/M2DE.jpg" alt="pipa on your knar" width="1920" height="1080"></a></p>  <h2><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</span></h2>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Mafia 2 is a beautiful game and definitely a game that you must have played. Unfortunately, the Definitive Edition isn&#39;t necessarily the best outcome to do that. Hopefully Hangar 13 can still prepare the necessary plaster to polish away the necessary mistakes because this is just a shame. Especially if this is the way to make the Mafia Remake generate a little more hype.</span></p></div>
