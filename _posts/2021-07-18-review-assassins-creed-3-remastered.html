The developer and publisher has learned a lot in the time between AC3 and Odyssey. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">After playing the remaster, this is something you will soon realize.</font></font><br></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Setting and story</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Assassin&#39;s Creed is known for its very interesting historical settings. "History is our Playground". Yes, who wouldn&#39;t want to have an Animus in their living room after playing an Assassin&#39;s game? The setting in Assassin&#39;s Creed 3 remains one of the most interesting in my opinion. The game plays very well on the past and the conflicts of that time. Bringing in the Brotherhood and the Templars is something they did very well in this. That goes for all Assassin&#39;s titles by the way. The reflection of the Templars to the current Abstergo is something that doesn&#39;t come into its own, but this has more to do with gameplay than design I think.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The play sessions you have when you&#39;re out of the Animus are tedious and completely interrupt the immersion. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Today&#39;s Assassin&#39;s games do this much less fortunately. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Once you go back into the Animus, Assassin&#39;s Creed 3 skips a few months or even years. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Understandable if you want to pull the story over a longer period of time with all its progress in that era. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">On the one hand, it&#39;s a shame because you don&#39;t form any bond with your character, in this case Connor Kenway.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">While the setting is great, it&#39;s a shame that the click with Connor simply isn&#39;t there. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This click was indeed present in previous games where Ezio took the lead. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">That while Connor in itself is a very interesting character since he was born in a conflict and is literally a mixture of water and fire.</font></font></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Visually still strong, but not liberating</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Assassin&#39;s Creed 3 and Liberation still look great in their remasters. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Ubisoft has taken a close look at the bundle to visually adapt the game to current expectations. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">With visually very strong titles such as Odyssey and Origins, this is very difficult. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Although dated, Assassin&#39;s Creed 3 and Liberation look very slick on the Playstation 4 Pro. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">4K visuals and textures come into their own, but this does not apply to everything.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The area, especially in the summer months, looks very good. The densely wooded area and the streets of Boston, among others, are very beautiful to see in 4K. In the winter months, the game is suddenly a lot less attractive. Snow looks a lot less good and covers a large part of the map. This provides an enormously simplistic image and does not allow the higher resolution to come into its own at all. The greatly improved lighting in the game does not manage to save it in the winter months of the remaster and in any case leaves me very cold.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">As soon as you come back in the summer period, the game is so beautiful again and it is really a picture to behold. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Although the environment looks beautiful, the same cannot be said about the many different characters. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Facial expressions are traditionally still very uncomfortable. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">As a result, the visuals of the environment and of the characters seem to be of a completely different caliber and do not fit well together.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><br></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Gameplay</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">At this point, the remaster again has a huge impact on the entire experience of the game with minor tweaks. In general, the game plays exactly the same as the original version, but small adjustments make for a game that plays much nicer.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The in-game economy has been adjusted, as it didn&#39;t actually play any role in the original game. You can now also craft weapons that were previously only sold in the store. The UI has also been slightly adjusted, the game now has an official color blind mode. On the minimap you can now see which way enemies are facing and where are hiding places if you are in conflict.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">You can now hide and whistle and bushes so that guards come to the sound. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This makes room for many more stealth options, something the franchise is known for. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">If you wanted to take out two guards at once, you were out of luck in the original game. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This no longer applies, because even in "low profile" you now have the option to perform a double assassination. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">In &quot;low profile&quot; the hidden blade is now also used by default when taking out enemies from behind. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This will keep you from being noticed by other enemies (if you&#39;re not in their line of sight, duh).</font></font></p><h3 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:1.75rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Combat now more brutal than ever</font></font></h3><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Seriously, combat in this game has never been better than before with the improvements above. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This in combination with the incredibly gruesome kills that you can perform in combat, this game is extremely entertaining in combat. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Especially with the many different weapons at your disposal. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Watching Connor take out two enemies at once through killstreaks never gets old.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><br></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Assassin&#39;s Creed 3 Remastered is still a very strong game in the franchise. Especially with the small subtle gameplay improvements, the game is a lot improved compared to the original game. Graphically, the game has improved slightly in certain respects, despite the original game being already very nice. Liberation also looks great on the PS4. The PS Vita game has received a huge facelift, but we already knew that after the HD version appeared a few years earlier. The game looked impressive on the Vita as well.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">That said, the game doesn&#39;t add much if you&#39;ve played the original games. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">all Single Player DLCs are included if you haven&#39;t played them yet, but the multiplayer mode is missing. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">If you haven&#39;t played these games yet, it is definitely recommended to pick up this game for the current generation. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">If you&#39;ve already played everything you won&#39;t miss much unless you want to play the game again with all the stealth improvements.</font></font></p></div>
