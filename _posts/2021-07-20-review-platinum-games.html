<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Explicitly mentioning Platinum Games in the title of this review is a must. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Why? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Because Platinum Games has shown time and again that they can create highly original and profound games. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">From Bayonetta </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">1</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> and </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">2</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> to </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">NieR: Automata</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> to now their very latest gem: Astral Chain!</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can tell from my reviews that I&#39;m quite a fan of Platinum Games. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This is mainly in terms of originality, content, drawing style, general atmosphere and gameplay. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Platinum is always coming up with new features, especially features that other studios don&#39;t see. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The Astral Chain is no exception to this. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game is only available for Nintendo Switch and quickly shows why the game is perfect for that. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Check out the launch trailer below!</font></font></p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/tL6CldIRowc/maxresdefault.webp" width="546" height="307"><br><br>            <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The Astral Chain</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   story of Astral Chain is one that you come across often. Earth is   unrecognizable and practically unlivable after an &#39;alien&#39; invasion.   Humanity is hiding in a place called the Ark. This Ark has also recently   been ravaged by the same invasion and it&#39;s up to you to put an end to   it. At the beginning of the game you can choose whether you want to be   male or female. That will also determine whether you get a sibling in   the game. Your character itself does not speak, but your brother or   sister does and often speaks for you. You two don&#39;t have a Legion at the   beginning of the story. Legions are robots that serve as your combat   partner. This Legion is linked to you through a chain called the Astral   Chain.</font></font></p>            <blockquote>            </blockquote><p style="margin-left:40px"><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><strong><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Did you know that</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> Astral Chain has a lot of secrets in the world. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">These secret missions can be found by exploring well and they don&#39;t feel like filler, but like fun side-objectives!</font></font></span></p><blockquote>           </blockquote>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Through this link you can see the enemy aliens. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">These &#39;Chimeras&#39; have it out on the Ark and have already invaded quite a bit when your story begins. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Your father is captain of the task force that the Howard twins (you and your brother/sister) will board. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The story is told through so-called &#39;cases&#39;. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">These cases are the levels you have to go through. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You start from a home base, something we are used to from NieR. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Personally,   I&#39;m glad it&#39;s not an open-world game, as level design is one of the   areas where Platinum Games makes it shine like twenty suns!</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Action Gameplay</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Just   like Bayonetta and NieR, Astral Chain is a true action title. The game   has no open world but works with levels. This is appropriate, given that   the story of the game is told linearly and does not have to take place   in a dynamic world. At the end of each level you get a score based on   aspects such as style and combos. What is immediately noticeable is that   the game does not have a jump button. The reason for this is really   big: Legions.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Legions   are your sidekicks in combat. You can collect, upgrade and use five   Legions however you want! For now, it is important to know that any form   of such a robot can offer you a completely different play style. You   can send your Legion to enemies and pull yourself there, but you can   also coordinate sync attacks. In the beginning of the game the combat   seemed very simple and not very well thought out, this made me a bit   anxious. That was, of course, until I found out how deep and fluid the   playstyles can get!</font></font></p>            <blockquote>            <p><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><em><strong><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Did you know that</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">   Astral Chain offers a couch co-op experience? If you want to play   together with your boyfriend or girlfriend, that is certainly possible.   For example, one of you will control the character, and the other the   Legion and camera. It takes some getting used to, but a pretty cool   experience. The approach to this is a bit like that of Super Mario   Odyssey, but better thought out! The unfortunate thing about this is   that you gain less experience with controlling your Legion yourself,   they could also have given you an extra character in the world with your   own Legion that supports you in combat.Â </font></font></em></span></p>           </blockquote>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Boss   fights were also good in mechanics and a fun challenge. Your Legion is   attached to you with a so-called &#39;Astral Chain&#39;, a chain that you can   use to take advantage of your battle in certain situations. For example,   you can run around the legs of a boss with that chain and then let him   fall over. These are those typical out-of-the-box scenes that only   Platinum Games can come up with and it&#39;s fantastic to play with!</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The combat isn&#39;t as fast-paced as Bayonetta but a bit faster than many NieR: Automata mechanics. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">What makes Astral Chain special is the other activities you perform. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You are of course a detective and that includes detective work. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Outside of the main story, there are plenty of people to help out with side quests. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   have to do a lot of detective work, this work is not very difficult but   gives a better pace to the game and provides some relief. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This also shows the human side of your character and you feel good when you help people in the world. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A   nice detail is that you can only cross the road when the light is   actually green, which is logical given that you, as an agent, have to   abide by the rules.</font></font><br> </p>                       <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">graphics</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Astral Chain is graphically just a top title. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   game brings out the power of the Nintendo Switch well and does not push   the engine to the extreme so that the game continues to run smoothly. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Despite that, the graphics fit perfectly with the atmosphere that Platinum wants to convey. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The Ark is a futuristic world full of neon lighting and Back to the Future scenes. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Enemy Design and bosses are great animations. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The music also fits nicely with the atmosphere that the game wants to set. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This provides a good overall impression of the atmosphere. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In-game dialogues are interesting and side-objectives are well-crafted. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The cinematics look great and spoken dialogues are again top notch and top shelf.</font></font></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Nothing is mediocre in the world of Platinum Games and Astral Chain is no exception. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Apart from a somewhat slow pace in the beginning of the game, there was little to criticize about this action title. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The combat plays smoothly, the Legions can be expanded considerably and the level design is fantastic. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I   can recommend this game to any Switch owner and it is a must-have title   for every Platinum Games fan and anyone with a Nintendo Switch at all.</font></font></p></div>
