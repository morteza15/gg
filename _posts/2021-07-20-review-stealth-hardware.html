<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">We are all familiar with the low budget gaming gear such as Big Ben and Speedlink. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Soon we will be able to add a new producer: Stealth. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">We have received three products to test. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This   concerns a headset, headstand and a charger for the PlayStation 4. Not a   high-tech review, but a simple intuitive gamers review of these   beautiful products.</font></font></h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   three Stealth products were neatly packaged. The boxes they came in   look fine and sturdy to take your newly purchased products with you.   What is immediately noticeable when holding those boxes is the weight of   the products. It seems as if the boxes were empty, everything feels so   light. Once opened, we luckily saw the products inside. First we pulled   out a headstand. Despite the fact that the stand is light in weight, the   whole feels sturdy and robust. The modern design fits well with your   headset and ensures that your headset stands out nicely. In short, a   very nice stand to store your headset when you&#39;re done gaming.</font></font><br><p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   second product we were allowed to test is a charger for your   PlayStation 4 controller. The charger is equipped with a USB cable and a   screen on which you can see whether your controller is charging and   when it has finished charging. The first thing that strikes me is the   charging method. Most chargers (including the ones I already have at   home) charge the controller from the back via the micro USB port. But   with this charger, the input points on the front of the controller are   used. The difference with this is directly measurable. The controller   from completely empty to full is done in at least an hour and a half.   While my other charger takes at least two to three hours to fully charge   it. In addition, the Stealth charger is small in size and takes up   almost no space.</font></font><br> </p>           <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Classic Gold Abstract Edition Stereo Gaming Headset</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Stealth&#39;s   latest product is the Classic Gold Abstract Edition Stereo Gaming   Headset. This headset can be used universally, but you do need to buy a   splitter for the PC. Because the headset only has one mini jack   connection. This is no problem for the consoles, just plug and play in   your controller and you&#39;re good to go. But for your PC you need to buy a   splitter that breaks up your signal to your mic input and sound output.   Unfortunately, this splitter is not included with the headset and I   would have liked to have seen it. However, for the seasoned gamer or   mature gamer, I would not recommend this headset in terms of fit. The   shells do not fall well over your hours and after an hour they hurt or   irritate. In addition, the headset feels fragile, but that can also be   due to the fact that the headset is super light.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But what surprises me most about this headset from Stealth is how good the quality of the sound and the microphone is. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Well it is not a Dolby surround sound headset, but the stereo sound comes into its own very well. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The sounds are crisp and clear. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The low bass tones are audible but not overpowering. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The volume is adjustable to the controller that is attached to your cable. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Here you can also mute your microphone. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The microphone works well and you are perfectly audible to the people you play with. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If you prefer to play alone, you can unscrew the microphone and put it next to you.</font></font><br> </p>           <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Stealth&#39;s   products are a great buy for the budget gamer or for parents who want   to provide their child with a headset. The headset costs around 30 euros   and is therefore a bargain compared to the big boys. But for the   seasoned gamer I wouldn&#39;t buy this one. The wearing comfort is not   optimal to sit on for hours. The charger is one that we recommend to   everyone. The controller is charged in no time and because it is so   compact you could just continue gaming. The headset stand is a nice   addition to store your headset or to display it when you&#39;re not gaming.   For the time being, you can only have the products come from England.   But if all goes well it will soon be available in the Netherlands   itself.</font></font></p></div>
