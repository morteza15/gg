<p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Codemasters  brings the Formula 1 season back to life in their new game F1 2018. A  game full of improvements and updates regarding graphical but also  gameplay aspects.&nbsp;</span></span></strong></h3>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">What makes F1 2018 so different from its predecessors?</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most  people who are not interested in racing games, it seems like nothing  changes every year. A few things have changed this year. The racing cars  have been given a different appearance, this is due to the Halo; that  ugly thing above the driver's cockpit. He may not look good, but he did  his job last weekend in Spa. We saw Alonso fly spectacularly over  Leclerc.</span></span></p>           <div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">            <div class="fitvids-video">                      </div>           </div>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Also,  the new Hypersofts have been introduced in the game. These can be  recognized by their light pink color, but can also be used on certain  circuits that can be counted on one hand. You notice the difference  clearly when you use these tires, a lot faster with the risk that your  tires wear very quickly. However, this extra choice of tires makes the  game a bit more interesting, so you can choose to be faster than your  opponents but have the risk that your Hypersofts fail sooner.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">To  give the game more realism, the game has also received a major update  based on information about your car. Codemasters has been working on  this aspect of the game for a long time to improve it. For example, they  were able to analyze data from several Formula 1 teams, which gave them  an idea of ​​how parts on a car function and degrade over time. This  makes the career mode feel a lot more realistic. Also, these things will  affect races that last longer than 5 rounds.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">F1  2018 also introduces the ERS system that can now be managed manually.  This aspect relates to the power of your car. By raising or lowering  this engine setting, you can get the right power from your car that is  needed for a certain scenario. If your parts are already heavily  degraded, it is wise to use a lower setting. As a result, you do lose  speed on straights, but you can drive longer with your parts.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Career mode is the same for every team but different at the same time. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Every  season starts with Australia and ends in Abu Dhabi, but it's the  choices you make during the season that make all the difference. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This applies to your own character but also to the parts of your car. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">So you can choose to be a team player or be a showman. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The statements you make during an interview can be good for certain teams and bad for some. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  car is also different for every team, so at Sauber you can focus on  aerodynamics with different end points, while at McLaren you have to  focus on engine power.</span></span></p>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Multiplayer is back in F1 2018 too</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  multiplayer is back to normal. Race against inexperienced drivers who  are constantly trying to ram you off the track. Sometimes fun, sometimes  irritating. Codemasters has found a solution for that. As always you  can create a custom lobby to race with your friends, but this year there  is also a ranked mode. In this playlist you ride against people of your  own caliber. This means that you will be matched against players who  drive the same as you. This can relate to your race pace but also how  sporty you are on the track.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Co-op  championship is also included but this is the same as F1 2017. These  are just races that you drive without any story behind it. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The advantage of this is that you can ride with or against your friends. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You also decide whether AI riders will participate or if the lobby is just open so that everyone can participate.</span></span></p>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">What do I think of F1 2018?</span></span></h4>           <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Codemasters  made some very good decisions with this game. In all areas, this game  is simply way better than its predecessors. There is much more depth to  the game that was just missing in the previous parts. Mainly we are  talking about the career mode which can be different every time.  Furthermore, all races have been made a lot more interesting by the new  choices that can be made. Especially the new tire choice and the fact  that you can adjust the power of the engine, every race no longer gets  the same outcome.</span></span><br /> &nbsp;<br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each car also has its unique sound, so you can clearly hear what kind of engine is in the back. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The sound difference between the 4 engines can be clearly heard but also felt in the performance. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cars also look a lot more realistic this year, which attracts me more into the game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not only are the cars beautiful again, but everything around them has also been given a major update. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The game really sucks you in if you're a real fan and that's what makes the game so much fun. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lots of unexpected things and different results keeps the game interesting. </span></span><div id="tap-translate"></div>
