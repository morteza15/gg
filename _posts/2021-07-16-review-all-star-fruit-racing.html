<p>&nbsp;</p><h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Mario Kart franchise is making karting games extremely popular and everyone is eager to grab a piece of the pie. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Recently a new karting game has been released called: All-Star Fruit Racing. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Does this title build on Nintendo's already excellent recipe?</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">All-Star Fruit Racing is a racing game similar to Mario Kart. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Different  types of karts, playable characters, power-ups and boosts by drifting  etc. The game is now available for Playstation 4, Nintendo Switch, PC  and Xbox One. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">We tested the game on a Nintendo Switch.</span></span></p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Familiar taste</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If  you are familiar with Mario Kart, this game will not take you long to  get used to. The control buttons are configured slightly differently,  but the general controls work exactly the same. Drifting provides an  extra speed boost and on the track you can collect different power-ups.  However, these work slightly differently than you will be used to. </span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In  All-Star Fruit Racing, the power-ups are spread over different fruits.  You have a kind of fruit tank in your kart. This will fill up with the  fruit you pick up in the circuit. Each fruit type has its own special  attack, but now comes the trick: You can combine fruit. Pick up enough  melons and bananas to completely fill both tanks and you can combine  your melon ability with the banana ability.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can choose your own abilities this way if you collect enough fruit for the desired moment. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are four different fruits in each circuit and you have four tanks to store these fruits. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you're patient enough to fill all four tanks completely, you can do a super ability. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The nice thing about this is that it differs per character. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone has the same fruit abilities, but the super ability is different for everyone.</span></span></p><p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"></span></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><a href="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/All-StarFruitRacing-1536x947.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="493" data-original-width="800" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/All-StarFruitRacing-1536x947.jpeg" /></a></span></span></div><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><br />&nbsp;</span></span><br /> <p></p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tune your fruit truck</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course customization is an important part of racing games. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is also the case in All-Star Fruit Racing where you can combine your own kart in more than 32,000 ways. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">From different body types, to wheels, and flags. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can set everything to your own taste. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The colors of each part can also be filled in according to your own wishes. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course you will first have to unlock various options by playing the game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then you can save your favorite styles to easily switch if you feel like a different look.</span></span><br /> <br /></p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Split screen fun</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The game offers enough game modes to keep you busy. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Especially with friends or family it is good old-fashioned laughter to do a race in between. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You  can play up to four players in Split-screen and here too, players can  choose their own character to pick a desired Super-ability. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If  you're not a fan of the in-game fruit mixer, you can also set up races  that default to using a random ability when you pick up fruit. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This makes it look a bit more like a game you already know. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately,  not everything will be immediately playable in this mode and you will  also have to unlock new tracks and areas the old-fashioned way.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sounds good, right?</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">One kind of Mario Kart but on all platforms, what more could you want? </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It might be close, but on the other hand, it's just not. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The biggest loss of All-Star Fruit Racing is the tracks you race on. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most circuits are very boring and can look alike. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Apart from your opponents, there are hardly any obstacles in your way. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even though everyone claims to hate these in Mario Kart, you should be glad they're there. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you're constantly in the lead and you don't have to worry about anything, the fun wears off quickly.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Verdict</span></span></h2>           <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">All-Star  Fruit Racing knows how to approach the genre with a fresh fruit look  and even throws some new flavors into the mix to develop their own  style. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although the game is fundamentally very good, the alignment is not perfect. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here  and there boards are missed, which in some cases could have been easily  adapted since the game offers a lot of customization. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  new additions to the karting genre, on the other hand, are very well  thought out and we would therefore like to see them come back in a next  karting game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">All in all, this karting game offers some new features on a accustomed basis. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whether  you want to deviate from this basis remains the question and that is at  the same time the charm and the lack of All-Star Fruit Racing. </span></span><div id="tap-translate"></div><div id="tap-translate"></div>
