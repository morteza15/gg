<div dir="ltr"><h3 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:1.75rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">FIFA 19 is just out and of course almost everyone is playing this game. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Still, there are always speculations as to whether the new change is actually worth the money. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">With all these changes in the game, we checked FIFA 19.</font></font></h3><h4 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:1.5rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">FIFA on the move</font></font></h4><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">As soon as we start FIFA 19, the first thing we see is the Kick-Off mode. This one has been given a makeover just like the rest of the game. All your data that you create in Kick-Off can be viewed everywhere. This year Electronic Arts has made it so that all your data is linked to your account. Getting the blood under your enemy&#39;s nails has never been so much fun now that you can actually prove that you&#39;re better by going by the numbers.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">House Rules is a fun method to play Kick-Off. Totally new in FIFA 19. With this mode it is possible to choose your own rules. For example, you can set that there are no rules, which promises a great kicking game. House Rules is therefore intended for those who want to play FIFA without the seriousness that comes with it.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Furthermore, little has changed in the career mode of the game, this may change a lot with FIFA 20, but nothing is certain.</font></font></p><h4 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:1.5rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Anyone can win in the Champions League</font></font></h4><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Electronic Arts&#39; new addition to FIFA is of course the Champions League. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This mode attracts a lot of attention and time for the real football fanatics. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">However, there are still points that could have been better. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">For example, an official team in FIFA is missing, so you can&#39;t imitate this year&#39;s entire competition. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Of course you can replace this team with another team but it doesn&#39;t give the real feeling. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">It is also the case that the player has to manually fill all pools, which is quite frustrating. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The advantage of this is that you have control over your own competition, but this can also be a disadvantage if you want to set up a competition &quot;quickly&quot;. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This way every team can participate in the Champions League and you decide who you play against. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">A Roda JC or FC Groningen who wins the cup, everything is possible!</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"></p><h4 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:1.5rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The Journey continues</font></font></h4><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The Journey continues in FIFA 19. The story of Alex Hunter continues, but this time you will also follow Kim Hunter and Danny Williams, both relatives of Alex Hunter. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Everyone has their own story but all have the same goal in mind, to become a hero.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">For Hunter, of course, his ultimate goal is to become champions with the big boys. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Although the story is compelling, it has limited depth in design. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Electronic Arts has imposed a high production value on this mode and that makes the gameplay experience good. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">For example, great attention has been paid to the details: for example, you play a match where you play as Alex Hunter&#39;s grandfather, Jim Hunter. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">During this match you take a step back in time, this can be clearly seen from the field, commentary and the scoreboard.</font></font></p><h4 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:1.5rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">FIFA with a different feel</font></font></h4><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">As soon as you step onto the field you don&#39;t notice that anything has changed, but the feeling you get is different. This is due to the additions and tweaks that have been made to make the game even better. It&#39;s mainly about the shooting and the passes you can make. EA changed the game in such a way that you have to play FIFA 19 tactically. By this we mean no more blind passes and better controlled deep balls. This creates more space in a different way, you will also have to change your playing style while playing.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Shooting has also completely changed, because there is a new method: Timed Finishing. This is a new way to separate the pros from the noobs. The Timed Finishing should make each shot more accurate and harder, if you hit it right. Essentially, the shot button has to be pressed twice, the first time a timer comes on. You have to hit the timer at just the right time to get the boost. If you miss the second part, your shot will go miles wide. The system works very well and touches on a very important aspect of the game. For the players who want to play FIFA as usual, there is of course an option to turn off the Timed Finishing. For example, FIFA 19 will behave like previous parts, which is not bad at all.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">However, there is a drawback in the shooting aspect. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Of course there is realism in the game, but this disappears if your player makes a successful bicycle kick time and time again. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This relates to shooting but also while defending or passing a ball. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Because of this one can quickly get the tendency to give high balls, which can cause irritation or jars that look alike.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">A real game changer is Dynamic Tactics. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This is a system that allows you to set 5 different tactics before the match that you can paste under hotkeys. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This way you can easily trigger them during a match. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This will make every offensive or defensive action the same, making FIFA 19 a lot more dynamic and more fun to play.</font></font></p><h4 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:1.5rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The Ultimate Team</font></font></h4><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This game mode has become the most important in the FIFA series in recent years. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Last year was not very positively received but we can not deny that it is always fun to play. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Ultimate Team is for the real competitive player. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Online Seasons has been given a change, however, as it will now be known as FUT Rivals. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">How it works has also changed, so in the new game mode you play divisions during the week where you can work your way up. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">However, this is done to prevent casual players from falling behind on their team.</font></font></p><h4 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:1.5rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font class="gmail-" style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h4><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">FIFA 19 is a good game with a lot of potential. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Since the gameplay and feel have completely changed from FIFA 18, this game brings fun back to the series. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The game modes that have been added are simply fun to do and can potentially attract a larger audience as the seriousness with these modes is thrown out the window. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The addition of Champions League is certainly a plus, but some things can still be improved, such as automating the filling of pools. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The game feels good despite the fact that there are still some bugs or unfinished aspects swirling around.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"> </p></div>
