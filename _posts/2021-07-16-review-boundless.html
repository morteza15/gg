<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Boundless, the new game from Wonderstuck where you can create your own story. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">A game that is sometimes reminiscent of Minecraft, but is so much more. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">But it still gave me a nostalgic feeling. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the game you can be an explorer, build impressive creations, network, roam or trade with fellow players. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">As the name suggests, limitless play in one of the many worlds in the universe. </span><span class="" style="vertical-align: inherit;">Develop your own storyline, start out as a half-naked homeless alien and see where the game takes you!&nbsp;</span></span></span></h3>           <h3><span style="color: #ff7f00;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Appearance of the game</span></span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  look of the game Boundless is simple and easy to handle. It has, if you  are on the right planet, a colorful environment. You have several trees  and also some plates that you can collect. The further away you look,  the simpler the view becomes. Walk somewhere and watch your game slowly  sharpen the environment and reveal details (your computer will love this  too, trust me). Scraping up resources works like some other similar  games. You ram it until it's broken, then it moves to your inventory.  The same goes for animals, you run up to them and start hitting them  aggressively with your totem, an item you receive at the start of the  game. Or if you are further in the game a sword or something similar.</span></span><br /> <br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Still,  not everything about the game is simple in graphics. There are  beautiful planets to see when it gets dark in the game, these are  planets that you can also go to. I had to say, I was impressed! But also  underwater or walking around on plains, small fireflies or twinkles in  the water made the game a bit magical. Also, the developers have  invested well in the game's music. I was pleasantly surprised by good  music that matched the game!</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your first house is primitive. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You don't know all aspects of the game yet. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Gradually you get the hang of putting the blocks to your liking. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can also make your blocks slant in the game, no more monotonous, square houses! </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It will take some time to gather resources, but it will give you time to think about how to expand or improve your home.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h3><span style="color: #ff7f00;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The beginning of your character</span></span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You  can develop your own character that you can play in-game! You create  some kind of alien race, very creative! When the game starts you will  receive an explanation from an NPC in the lobby, here you will receive  your first totem and you can teleport to your first world. The tutorial  is long, and not always clear. Fortunately, the game gives you tips time  and time again, so you can learn them slowly. The game gives you the  option to learn a tip, it will not reappear in your game.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You  maneuver through a portal to your chosen spot on the starting planet. I  chose an inhabited part of the world so that I could look at structures  and other online players. Next, you have to choose a piece of land  where you will build a new dream home for yourself. Whether you do this  in a city, near special monuments in the game or in a remote place, in  the air, on the water, it's all up to you. It starts with making a  campfire, and so you build on to a place where you feel at home, the  possibilities are endless! How to make your land uncultivable for other  players was a bit of a puzzle. Just like cooking and consuming the food,  I only died a few times, food is something to figure out. But once you  can roughly survive you can start exploring.</span></span><br /> <br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you play the game you have a lot of assignments. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you do this you get XP, you can also earn this by collecting resources or killing animals. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">By getting XP you can level up, with each level you get a kind of loot box. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This includes in-game money, more XP, extra resources or points. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can use these points to develop character traits of your doll. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, you can add extra life, make you run faster and more. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This makes playing fun! </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">And don't worry, if you die you will keep all your XP and points.</span></span><br /> &nbsp;<br /> </p>           <h3><span style="color: #ff7f00;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Online!</span></span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  game is online, so get your friends together to live together on a  planet of your choice! With many available worlds and not very many  players yet, it is a bit of a search for social contacts. But now that  the game is over, many people will soon be joining and the cities will  be buzzing with fellow aliens. Opt for a peaceful get-together and open  your own shop. The game lets you trade goods for rock hard (in-game)  cash, what more could you want? Just like walking into the supermarket.  Or start your own clan, ready to take down enemies and newbies. You set  the limit!</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the game you can chat with each other. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Press enter and you can let your fellow players know who you are. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Can't express yourself enough with typing? </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then use the in-game expressions to reinforce your story. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It  would be nice if there was also voice chat, then you can, for example,  announce your new market stall offers on Saturday morning.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h3><span style="color: #ff7f00;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Verdict</span></span></span></h3>           <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">A  game that made me feel slightly nostalgic, a refreshing new look and a  familiar way of playing. A fun way to spend time with your friends or  get to know new players. I can certainly believe that people can have  hours of fun with this! The tutorial is a bit difficult and sometimes a  challenge, I ran into this. But luckily after a while I knew roughly how  my house remained mine and would not disappear and that you have to  prepare food in a cooking pot. The different worlds are also a lot of  fun. Not all worlds are equally peaceful, there are also planets without  oxygen. This makes it challenging to explore!</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is also a possibility to spend real money on the game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fortunately, it is not necessary to spend money to make a better game for yourself. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can pay to join the special community, here you have some little extras or you can buy boxes with resources. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Luckily no levels or points to boost your properties. </span></span><p>&nbsp;</p><div id="tap-translate"></div>
