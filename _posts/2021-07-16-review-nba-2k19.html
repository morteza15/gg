<p>&nbsp;</p><h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's that time again, NBA throws another year on top with the 2019 variant on a centuries-long series. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yet 2K Games does it every year to make it a masterpiece, did they succeed this year?..</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">NBA is </span></span><i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">THE&nbsp;</span></span></i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> game of the year </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">for most basketball fans&nbsp; </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">, the title they are most looking forward to. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">For that reason, there is a lot of pressure on 2K Games to put new elements in it every year. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not only this, but there must also be a graphic upgrade, new music and that urban / sporty atmosphere must be strongly present. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This year is again the icing on the many cherries on top of the cake. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The game maintains its essential foundation, but adds content and features. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Check out the trailer for NBA 2K19 below.</span></span></p><p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"></span></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><a href="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/bIzP0En2aZ4/maxresdefault.webp" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="450" data-original-width="800" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/bIzP0En2aZ4/maxresdefault.webp" /></a></span></span></div><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><br />&nbsp;</span></span><p></p>           <div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">            <div class="fitvids-video">                      </div>           </div>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The familiar atmosphere is present again!</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">At  NBA I want to be able to pop, to feel like I want to completely crush  the opponents. This year, that atmosphere is fully integrated again for  me. The music is great with artists from Travis Scott to Dua Lipa to  Fall Out Boy. In fact, </span></span><i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Travis Scott</span></span></i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is the creative producer this year, which also makes for a nice variation. As usual, 2K posts another </span></span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Spotify playlist</span></span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> where all those songs can be checked in! The list is full of rap, pop,  house and more! You'd say music doesn't have to be terribly important,  but in a sports title like this one can set the mood at many moments.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  SFX sounds are back on point too, from slipping your pattas along the  floor to throwing the ball into the net, the sounds in the game are top  notch. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Graphically we  don't have to say much more about NBA, the game puts itself far above  other titles in the sports world and the face scan is also present again  for some laughs with your friends. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">An upgrade is certainly present and for the fans also a real eye-catcher. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Where you'll mostly see this upgrade is in the replays, close-ups, and cutscenes.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">it's back</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your  own character's storyline returns in 2K19. The story is strong again  and during the first season you will learn a lot about the life of your  character. This time it is not just a story, this because you will start  in aâ€¦ more special place. You essentially follow the road from China to  the NBA, with many ups and of course many downs. As a player, NBA knows  how to get you into 'the feels' this time. The game puts a much higher  level on the story than previous years. There is a new neighbourhood.  Just like in 2018, the game feels like an open-world title. This year,  however, there is a step up! There is a better layout of the  neighborhood and it all runs a bit smoother, also in performance. The  loading times also seem much shorter than last year, a small but  certainly comfortable plus.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There  is plenty to do and explore in this area. Unfortunately, the game hall  from 2K18 has been removed. There's sort of a substitute for this, but  it doesn't completely fill the gap, contrary to the expectation that  more new additions to the modes would come. MyCourt also doesn't have  enough changes to actually say anything about it. Of course this can  always be added later, something that doesn't feel strange after  previous years. The game feels a lot more challenging to the point where  it sometimes seems unfair, this is no problem for the veteran. However,  a beginner will have to work better on his learning curve here before  he will get far in the game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are new modes of play in the open world to explore and play. One of them is&nbsp; </span><i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dodgeball.&nbsp;</span></i></span><br /> <br /><i></i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">These  are games in the open neighborhood that everyone who walks by can  participate in, think of an interactive event as a better name. During  these events you can earn more points and unlockables for your  character. So you can upgrade your character considerably with this. On  that note... creating your own character always feels like one of the  best elements in the games. This way you actually get the feeling of  progress. You can fully customize your doll from A to Z. </span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do  you want new shoes? Run past a sneaker store dude. Do you want new  clothes? You can earn extra points for your character with the FaceScan  app. That's no problem either,&nbsp; </span></span><i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">go spend that money you earned</span></span></i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">! </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There  are also fun interactions between players such as dancing and of course  playing with your friends in a party and having fun, or in this case; </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">throw. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fun things like advertising for JBL, for example, are also in the game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or trampoline jumping, I mean, WHAT? </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Finally, you have the option to play a kind of ToTo, the more you guess correctly, the more points you can earn!</span></span></p>           <div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">            <div class="fitvids-video">                      </div>           </div>           <h3><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Verdict</span></span></h3>           <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">NBA 2K19 surprised me again in a very positive way! </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The game is full of fun elements and adds a lot of possibilities. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In  terms of content, there is certainly not too little and the game can be  quite challenging, not everyone will have it easy with that. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The open world is what keeps surprising me with fun aspects. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The gameplay is old and familiar with MyTeam, MyGM and Fantasy Drafts. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are some minor hiccups here and there but 2K continues to deliver a top game, every year. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The controls are also nice and graphically there are a lot of nice upgrades. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">I can definitely recommend the game again this year. </span></span><div id="tap-translate"></div><div id="tap-translate"></div>
