<div dir="ltr"><h4 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:1.5rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The Playstation Classic is Sony&#39;s answer to Nintendo&#39;s NES and SNES mini consoles. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">After all, it does the same thing, only for Playstation games. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The Playstation Classic contains 20 pre-installed games.</font></font></h4><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Sony supplies the Playstation Classic with an HDMI cable, USB power cable and two controllers. There is no adapter included. If you want to provide the device with power, you must have an adapter at home. If you don&#39;t have an adapter, all devices that supply power via USB will work too! For example, I used my Playstation 4 to power the Classic. Saves another space in the socket. However, an adapter is a slightly neater solution, because good cable management gives us a loud horn.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The Playstation Classic does exactly what Nintendo&#39;s NES and SNES mini consoles do. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">It emulates games from the past, in this case, games that were playable on the Playstation 1 at the time. However, you can&#39;t choose the games yourself. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The device has 20 games pre-installed on the device. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">You can only play these 20 games, you cannot download or buy additional games. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This brings us to the Classic&#39;s first critique.</font></font></p><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-size:2rem;text-align:center">Line up</span></p><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The Playstation Classic has 20 games, but they are not exactly the games you would expect, or are iconic for the Playstation 1. For example, perhaps three or four most iconic Playstation games from the good old days are missing. Crash Bandicoot, Spyro and MediEvil are missing from the lineup. On the one hand, this is not very strange, since Crash and Spyro are fully equipped with a remaster for the current generation of consoles and MediEvil is on the way, but Gran Turismo is also missing, for example.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Fortunately, there are also very good games in the line-up. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Rayman, Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy 7 and Tekken 3 play wonderfully on the Playstation Classic. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">While playing you can see yourself going all the way back in time where everything, especially everything, was much better, right? </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Playing 2D games such as Rayman is no problem at all for the Classic, but as soon as you want to play a 3D game, everything gets a lot more complicated.</font></font></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">design</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The controllers that are included do not have analog sticks. Why? No idea. Maybe for the extra nostalgic factor. In addition, the Classic only supports the two supplied controllers. You cannot connect your old Playstation 1 or Playstation 2 controllers. The &#39;new&#39; controller uses USB. This &#39;problem&#39; could have been solved very easily if Sony had developed a connector so that you could also connect the old controllers to the Playstation Classic. At the moment, certain games like Rainbow Six are simply unplayable. Maybe something for the future, but for now it&#39;s an obvious flaw.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">We have now been working with the device for less than half an hour, after which we have already encountered two major obstacles that nullify the effectiveness of the Classic. There is nothing to say about the appearance. The device looks great and on the outside it is a 1-on-1 copy of the OG Playstation. Even the controller is completely identical to the original controller. That said, the Classic controller does feel a lot cheaper than the original, like you&#39;ve bought a Chinese counterfeit. Other than that, it functions exactly the same, as expected. The only difference to the controllers is the length of the cable. The cable of the Classic is at least half a meter shorter, so you have to sit closer to the TV, something we may not be used to these days since all modern controllers are wireless.</font></font></p><span style="font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-size:2rem;text-align:center">Gameplay</span><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">A tricky point to discuss is the gameplay of the Classic. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Game controls used to be a lot different than we are used to today. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Where we come across a &#39;standard&#39; nowadays, this is not really self-evident in the Classic Line-up. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">You will soon notice this when you start games for the first time. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Pressing START to play, for example, is really &#39;start&#39;. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">No cross or square. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Nowadays we are so used to having all those buttons standardized, so you would expect the same controls for a kind of same game. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Certain games are simply playable as you would expect. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">No problems with most titles, but it quickly becomes uncomfortable when you look at how to control Rainbow Six.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">In general, you can say that games used to be much more difficult. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The silly controls and camera controls are major shareholders of this statement, it turns out. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Although the control of games is not in the hands of Sony at all, it is a point that will influence your experience, where you can again wonder whether certain games belong in this line-up.</font></font></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Retro gaming remains interesting, for young and old alike. Playstation Classic does exactly what you expect it to do and is therefore a great console for some old-fashioned gaming fun. At least that&#39;s true if you&#39;re not very interested in very specific titles from the OG Playstation era. It&#39;s great that two controllers are included as standard for old-school couch multiplayer, but it&#39;s a shame that there are no analog sticks on it, which makes certain titles very difficult to play. In addition to the line-up that leaves something to be desired, not much seems to have been done to optimize certain games, which means that certain games are not fun to play.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This is very unfortunate as this console with a price tag of € 100, - could have been the perfect solution for gamers who missed the OG Playstation time. €5 per game, with certain titles supporting multiplayer is not very expensive. But then the games have to be interesting enough and playable. Sony seems to have just missed the mark with their answer to the SNES and NES mini. Still, no console can compete with the oh so nostalgic boat sound of the OG Playstation and luckily this is also in the Classic! So are you not so picky and you no longer have the original Playstation, or Playstation 1 games on your Playstation 3 or Playstation Vita? Then the Playstation Classic is a great solution. However, do you want to play the most iconic games of yesteryear? Then you will unfortunately have to look for an alternative solution.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Some games on the device are great, work perfectly and, despite being dated, still look very good. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Unfortunately, this does not apply to the entire package. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Still, I&#39;ll be entertained for hours with Rayman, Metal Gear Solid, and Final Fantasy 7. Tekken 3 is always a good way to settle disagreements once and for all.</font></font></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">A gadget</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This is how I would best describe the Playstation Classic. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Not the best solution for Retro gaming when it comes to Playstation games, but it does the job. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">In addition, the device itself looks beautiful and it is always nice to add to your collection. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">It is also an ideal device for retro game evenings with some friends, since you can connect it in no time. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Its size also makes it very easy to take with you.</font></font></p></div>
