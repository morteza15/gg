<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit" class="gmail-">As   a little boy I grew up with the Star Wars movies. As I got older, the   Star Wars games came to the various consoles I owned as a child and   teenager. Legendary games like the original Star Wars Battlefront 2 (not   the bad version from past years), Star Wars Knights of the Old   Republic, Star Wars Lego and Star Wars the Force Unleashed were all   great games to play. After the failure of the modern versions of Star   Wars Battlefront, my faith in the Star Wars game was a bit damaged. Can   Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Restore My Confidence?</font></font></h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A   great series of Star Wars is currently running on Disney+. The   Mandalorian takes place between the film&#39;s parts six and seven. Star   Wars: Fallen Order takes place between the third and fourth films. With   that we see more and more of the in-between periods of the films. In the   Fallen Order you play as the character Cal. Cal was a Padawan before   the Empire executed order 66. Since the Jedi were wiped out, Cal lives a   hidden and lonely life. During his hidden army, he is discovered by the   Empire and a manhunt is launched for him. When it seems all over, Cal   is rescued by Cere Junda and Greez Dritus.</font></font><br><p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The three of them go to an ancient temple where the secret lies to restore the Jedi Order. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Here Cal meets his new droid friend BD-1. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">BD-1 helps you through the game by giving you stimpacks to heal yourself. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In addition, BD-1 can scan the environment for your database and to earn XP. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">With this XP you get skill points to further develop as a Jedi. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In addition, in Star Wars: Fallen Order, BD-1 creates the map for you of the planets you go to. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">BD-1 is a fun and cheerful droid that helps you to restore the Jedi Order.</font></font><br> </p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gameplay and Graphics</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Star   Wars Jedi: Fallen Order very much brings back the feel of Star Wars:   The Force Unleashed. Fighting with your lightsaber is well developed in   the Fallen Order. The controls are quite fluid and responsive to   whatever you want to do. But if you think that as an invincible Jedi you   can attack your opponents, then you are wrong. The opponents in your   game require a little more than a simple hit from your lightsaber. And   besides, most opponents also do great damage to you if you don&#39;t dodge   or defend. Of course you have various Jedi tricks to help you defeat all   these enemies, or to decide a battle in your favor.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">As   we mentioned before, you earn XP to earn skill points. With these skill   points you can improve Cal as a Jedi. Think of new attacks, Jedi tricks   and survival tools. The planets you will visit offer a lot of space to   discover. Not only do you have to keep yourself busy with the story, you   can also take the time to discover all the secrets of the planets you   can go to in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This will give you XP, but   also new outfits or upgrades for BD-1 and your lightsaber. The way this   is done reminds me a lot of games like Lara Croft and Uncharted. Lots   of puzzle elements and secrets to discover outside of the story. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But besides all the gameplay elements, we can also enjoy the graphics of the game. We have the game on the</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Played </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">PlayStation 4 Pro</font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> and the planets look beautiful. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Well it&#39;s not Horizon Zero Dawn but Star War: Fallen Order does look good. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The scenery around the background is beautifully beautiful. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">When you look at the gigantic ships in the background in the beginning, we couldn&#39;t stop taking a closer look at them. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However, we have to say that the faces in Fallen Order sometimes look a bit strange. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Cere Junda, for example, has those moments when it seems as if her eyes could fall out at any moment.</font></font><br> <br></p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Finally   we can speak of a good Star Wars game again. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen   Order brought back to me the good feeling of the game Star Wars: The   Force Unleashed. Fighting with the Force and your lightsaber feels good   once you get the basics down. The skill tree looks clear and offers the   necessary upgrades to become even stronger as a Jedi. In addition, the   planets are great locations to explore and to look for all the secrets.   The puzzles are entertaining and if you can&#39;t figure it out there are   always tips you can get from BD-1. The story is compelling and offers a   few interesting plot twists that we certainly won&#39;t tell you. Fallen   Order looks good in terms of graphics, it&#39;s just a shame that there are   moments when the faces in the game leave something to be desired.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But   after the massive flop of Star Wars Battlefront, my faith in Star Wars   games has completely recovered after playing Star Wars Jedi: Fallen   Order. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It may not be the   best Star Wars game, but it certainly deserves a spot among the   legendary games we listed at the beginning of the review.</font></font></p></div>
