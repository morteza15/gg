<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Death   Stranding, Hideo Kojima&#39;s masterpiece. The first game from Kojima   Productions, and what a game. At E3 2016, we were left ignorant of what   kind of game Death Stranding would become. All we could see at the time:   Faint shadows in the sky, a black beach full of dead animals, Norman   Reedus and a baby. We were none the wiser in the trailers that followed.   All we knew was that more and more famous actors and actresses were   added to the game. We already got to play the game, and today we can   finally tell you more about Death Stranding.</font></font></h4>            <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Kojima&#39;s   Death Stranding is a thrilling thriller where your goal is to connect   people. Norman Reedus plays Sam Porter, and works for PostNL. No   kidding, Sam is a deliverer of goods to the people who live in shelters.   Because America and the world are having a hard time and a lot of the   country has been destroyed. This is due to the peculiar creatures called   BTs. BTs are shadows of beings from the afterlife. They roam and devour   anyone who comes their way. In addition, America has to deal with void   outs. These are mega explosions that come from people who have died. The   corpse must be cremated within a few days, otherwise the corpse will   explode. And then there are terrorists who use this to ensure that   America is not united.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In Death Stranding, Sam is asked to help reunite America. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Reluctantly, Sam begins his task. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">America must be connected by Chiral Network. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You do this by connecting the different Knots together. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">With this you create new &#39;Strands&#39; and the shelters can communicate with each other. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">While doing this you must also deliver goods that the people of the shelters need. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For most, that is enough to persuade them to join, but a few sometimes want to be difficult and you have to do a little extra. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">As you do this, the story develops further and further with each Knot you add to the Chiral Network.</font></font></p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ShA87UEu1R8/hqdefault.webp" width="480" height="360"><br><br><p> </p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Ambience in Death Stranding</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">We   want to tell you as little of the story as possible, because the story   itself is great. Hideo Kojima is a true genius in terms of story with   Death Stranding. The entire game is full of immersive cutscenes with   matching music. The music in the game is superb. Both during the   cutscenes and while walking around, the music comes in just right and   adds even more color to the fantastic game. As soon as a song starts,   goosebumps crawled up my arms and then you know it&#39;s really good.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The graphics of Deaths Stranding are great. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Kojima takes all the power from the PlayStation 4 to put down a beautiful game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Norman Reedus and the rest of the actors look lifelike. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The landscape is beautiful to see. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">When you have climbed a mountain and you look around you, you can enjoy a beautiful view. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Everything   has been thought of, the natural course of water, hair and plants that   move with the wind, footprints you leave behind, snow that you push   aside, everything looks lifelike. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Playing the game is like being on vacation in a beautiful nature reserve.</font></font><br> </p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gameplay</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Death   Stranding is a mix of gaming and watching a movie. The story mainly   continues in beautiful and long cut scenes. The game part is mainly   going from A to B with goods that you have to bring in a perfect or good   condition. And this is more difficult than said. The terrain you are   going over is strewn with stones, rocks, mountains and rivers. Any of   these elements can damage your cargo. In addition, you also have to deal   with chemical rain that affects your boxes. Roads no longer exist, so   you will have to go through the rough nature. Also, the weight and the   way you distribute your load influences how you have to control Sam. The   more cargo you carry, the more unstable and slower Sam walks. And by   unstable, we mean really unstable. Are you are fully packedthen a small   healing can be enough to take you completely off balance.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Fortunately,   there are also vehicles in the game. Although fortunately, as we have   said before, the terrain is quite overgrown. This means you can&#39;t race   like crazy from A to B with your motorcycle or truck. Usually it is even   faster to go on foot than with a vehicle. Because for all obstacles you   also get tools to overcome them. For example, you can lay ladders over   rivers and use a climbing anchor to climb a piece of mountains. But you   can also build different objects in Death Stranding. Bridges, mailboxes,   shelters can all be built to help you get through the rough terrain.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">And with the latter we come straight to the online aspect of Death Stranding. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">When connected to the internet you can use objects from other players. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can also leave tips for players to watch out for. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">So everything you build or leave behind can be used by other players. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Because if you&#39;ve conquered everything you&#39;ve read above, then you still have the BTs and the Mules. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Rest assured your world won&#39;t be filled with every player&#39;s build. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There is a build limit on what is visible in your world. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In addition, the Timefall ensures that buildings slowly break down.</font></font></p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">BTs and Mules the enemies in Death Stranding</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Fortunately,   Death Stranding does not only consist of delivering packages. You can   also fight to your heart&#39;s content with BTs and Mules. Mules are people   who are after your packages. They use it to recycle materials. In   addition, they are fond of chasing people like Sam. The downside to   these guys is that you can&#39;t kill them. Because they are just people and   if a person is dead, he must be cremated. Luckily for that you get   enough non-lethal weapons to fight them if they bother you. Mules live   in camps worth robbing. There are often many goods with materials that   you can use to build objects.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">BTs   are the nebulous creatures associated with the afterlife. When you get   to an area with BTs, your Odradek scanner will turn on. It indicates in   which direction a BT is located. If you stand still with Sam you can   also see the BTs and where they are. Once you&#39;re in the area with BTs,   be careful and sneak around to get through the area undetected. Getting   too close or making noise will make the BTs come at you. And then you&#39;re   in quite a bit of trouble, BTs drag you along and spawn a huge black   monster that tries to kill you. And those non-lethal weapons don&#39;t work   against those bastards. For this you have weapons that use Sam&#39;s blood.   And you have to be careful that your blood level does not get too low,   because your blood level is also your HP bar. And when your HP bar runs   out,you&#39;ll end up on your own Death Stranding.</font></font></p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Minuses and Verdict</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Despite the fact that Death Stranding is a great game in many ways, the game is not perfect. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Some actions are clumsy or don&#39;t go as planned. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Turning around your axis, for example, can sometimes cause unfortunate falls. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The vehicles that you can use regularly get stuck on the smallest stones or even come to a complete standstill. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">When placing your ladders, it also wants to prevent you from placing a ladder completely wrong. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">When carrying goods in your hand, you must hold down R2 or L2 all the time. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This is quite annoying when you have to walk a long way with those goods in your hand. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I prefer that you have to press that button once and that Sam then carries the suitcase himself. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Apart from these negatives,</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Death Stranding </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">a   must have game. Hideo Kojima outdoes himself with this title. Although   the gameplay can be repetitive at times, the cutscenes, music and story   make up for a lot. The negatives from above are also insignificant if   you take the entire experience of the game. The actors do their job   superbly and tell the story wonderfully. The music in the game fits   seamlessly into your gameplay and in the cutscenes. Graphically, the   game is a picture in which you can enjoy the environment through which   you dredge. The encounters with BTs and Mules are not annoying or   impossible. We played it on the second highest difficulty and it was   doable for a first playthrough. If that is still too difficult, you can   go down another two degrees. After playing Death Stranding,I can only   look forward to a new game from Hideo Kojima as he certainly does not   disappoint anyone with this game.</font></font></p></div>
