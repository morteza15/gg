<h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Doom, Crash Bandicoot, Rocket League, NBA, Fifa and WWE. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">These are all titles that have been ported to the Nintendo Switch. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some of those titles were great additions to the handheld, could this title be too?</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">By now everyone is familiar with Wolftenstein II: The New Colossus. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The game came out quite some time ago, October 27, 2017 to be exact, for the Playstation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows PCs. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you've played this game, the Switch port might not be that interesting to you, well, I think it is! </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">As with Doom, Wolfenstein has something unique to add to this family-friendly handheld, which is great. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nintendo is known for the softer titles for the time being. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">A game like Bayonetta is already getting a little closer to 18+, but the two Bethesda titles are not comparable. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Check out below how you can blow Nazis' heads open in this beautiful title.</span></span></p>           <div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">            <div class="fitvids-video">                      </div>           </div>           <h3><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Graphics and performance</span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Panic  Button also ported Doom a while ago, this game looked great but  certainly didn't come without some issues. Wolfenstein struggles with  the same issues, which in my opinion is still an advantage, given the  game looks fan-tas-tic. With a performance of 30 frames-per-second and a  maximum resolution of only 720p, I noticed very little of what is on  paper. The game looks great, even in handheld mode, which is where I  mostly played it. In some intense parts the frames could drop, but the  game remains nice and playable. Cinematics look great and the blur is  also a lot less than it was with Doom.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Something that is immediately implemented with this title, are the motion controls. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">These work on the Joy-Cons as well as the Pro Controller. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This  makes aiming a lot easier and is a system that could really help  players in games like Zelda, as aiming in handheld mode can be quite  tricky. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can of course also choose to turn on aim-assist. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In terms of bugs I didn't come across anything special, nothing game-breaking or anything like that, it's okay in that area!</span></span><br /> <img alt="wolfenstein II switch" class="alignnone" height="1080" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/sm.ign.com/ign_nl/video/2/22-minutes/22-minutes-of-wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-on-switch-pax-e_uvb3.jpg" width="1920" /></p>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kopfschmerzen</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Blasting  heads of Nazi scum is the specialty of wounded William BJ Blazkowicz.  The Nazis won World War II by taking advantage of the industrial  revolution in the field of robots. This part is all about reclaiming the  world, starting with Frau Engel, a sadistic commander in the German  army. The game takes place after&nbsp; </span></span><em><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The New Order</span></span></em><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , but you don't need to have played this part to understand what's  going on, as there are plenty of flashbacks. Also in this part you get  more backstory for the protagonist, BJ</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">People who said last year that single player games are dead were seriously mistaken when The New Colossus came out. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This title still has one of the best storylines that came out last year in our beautiful gaming world. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The story is very original anyway, and so is the whole setting. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">I  mean, you have Nazis in mechanical robots shooting you with lasers  while you run around with akimbo machine gunsâ€¦ If that's not cool?! </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This part also has more gore moments, more weapons and better graphics, despite the Switch downgrade. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The title is, of course, based on&nbsp; </span></span><em><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Man in the High Castle</span></span></em><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Despite that, the game series has built a better world than that described in TMitHC.</span></span><br /> <img alt="wolfenstein 2 switch gameplay" class="alignnone" height="720" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi/fDsgANlMB0A/maxresdefault.jpg" width="1280" /></p>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Verdict</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is not much else to say about this port. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wolfenstein II is a great, breathtaking single-player shooter that once again shows the power of the Nintendo Switch. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If  you want to see the game in its full glory, then I of course recommend  that you buy the regular version, if you want to enjoy the diversity  that the Nintendo Switch has to offer, don't miss this title. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bethesda delivered a great story and Panic Button continues to drive strong sales to the hybrid handheld/ console. </span></span><br /> <span style="color: #ff7f00;"><strong><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pros</span></span></strong></span></p>           <ul class="fa-ul" style="list-style: none;"><li><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Killing Portable Nazis</span></span></li><li><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Performance, both plus and minus</span></span></li><li><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Graphics strong on handheld</span></span></li><li><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Great storyline</span></span></li></ul>
