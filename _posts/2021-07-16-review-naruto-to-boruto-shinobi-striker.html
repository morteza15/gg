<p>&nbsp;</p><h3><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There  are so many anime fighting games coming out, some of them make it in  this huge list, but not every anime game is equally good. </span></span><i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Where</span></span></i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> will </span><i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker</span></i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> be placed?</span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">At Gamescom this year I got to play&nbsp; </span></span><i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jump Force&nbsp;</span></span></i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and&nbsp; </span></span><i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">One Piece: World Seeker&nbsp;</span></span></i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Both games felt great. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Naruto to Boruto is one of the games that I didn't have any prior experience with at Gamescom. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The game starts in the universe where Naruto's children will lead the new generation. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Boruto is the newest series in the Naruto universe and will be the standard for years to come. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This game picks up on that timeline. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is therefore the intention that you be led up to great Shinobi.</span></span></p><p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"></span></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><a href="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/LC5vurSL9oI/maxresdefault.webp" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="450" data-original-width="800" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/LC5vurSL9oI/maxresdefault.webp" /></a></span></span></div><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><br />&nbsp;</span></span><p></p>           <div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">            <div class="fitvids-video">                      </div>           </div>           <h3><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your character, your story</span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In&nbsp; </span></span><i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shinobi Striker you&nbsp;</span></span></i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> can create your own character. You start by choosing your village, your  beginner outfit will also be based on this choice. Then you can adjust  things like your hair, face, make-up, wrinkles and face-marks. There is  quite a bit of choice and that choice gets even bigger later in the  game. You can use well-known hairstyles, but also unique ones.  Ultimately, it is also possible to unlock or collect more outfits and  variables.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  game is essentially an online phenomenon, but you can also play  missions solo. You always start in a lobby, just like with Xenoverse.  This lobby is the center square of the Hidden Leaf Village. If you look  up you immediately see the faces of all the Hokage and the apartment  buildings that have been built in the Boruto universe. In front of you  is the building where Naruto, the current Hokage, does his work. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You  are supposed to play online missions. You can play the storyline, or  engage in online battles against each other. You can also play through  the old, iconic storylines of the Naruto or Boruto series. The game is  very in touch with the actual series, so you can also unlock signature  moves and weapons from the original show.</span></span><br /> <br /><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If  you choose to play the original part of the story, these usually have  nice cutscenes, these are well constructed and look fancy. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your own character will of course not appear in these cinematics. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately, the other solo/online missions are nothing special. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">After a few hours of playing, it's like doing chores. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Go  here, beat these guys, find this object, replay", this is what you have  to deal with after a few hours for the rest of the game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">A certain grind to unlock new things.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h3><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Luckily there is multiplayer</span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fortunately,  this is mainly a multiplayer game. The online modes are a lot more fun.  You have modes like Capture the Flag and Defend your Base, these are  all super fun to play. You soon notice that the budget of the game was  not too high, given the options quickly run out. In the online modes  there is a kind of tactic that you have to get through with your team.  For example, you can lure other Shinobi into the bottomless pit, or have  one of your team go the other way while you distract the enemies. This  makes for a different round every time.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The combat is therefore quite simple. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You get special Ninjutsu on L1 and R1, a Substitution on L2, and a Long Jump on R2. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can make combos with square and triangle and also use ranged attacks. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This combat is well implemented and feels quite fluid when you get the hang of it. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you get the combinations right, you can even have multiple enemies at the same time, something I often miss in a game.</span></span><br /><br /></p>           <h3><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Verdict</span></span></h3>           <i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker&nbsp;</span></span></i><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> may not be the very best implementation of an anime, but you can tell that the developers have a big heart for their game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">I see this as a foundation for a new generation of online anime titles. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Xenoverse 1 wasn't a perfect game either, but the second part was very well received. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am sure it will be the same with this game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anyone who wants a fun online experience in their favorite franchise I definitely recommend to buy the game! </span></span><div id="tap-translate"></div><div id="tap-translate"></div>
