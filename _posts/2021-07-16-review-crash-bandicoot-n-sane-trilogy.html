<p>&nbsp;</p><h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Every gamer is familiar with Crash Bandicoot. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first three games on the original Playstation might just be one of your first games of all time. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">A  remaster of the original trilogy was released last year for the  Playstation 4. It was recently released for Nintendo Switch, Xbox One  and PC.</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">A few months ago during a Nintendo Direct episode, we saw an appearance that came as a surprise to many. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Crash Bandicoot! </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">That same evening, Activision announced that the game would indeed appear on other platforms.</span></span><br /></p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Looks like N. Sane!</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  N. Sane trilogy features the first three original Crash Bandicoot  platformers developed by Naughty Dog. Vicarious Visions ensured that  these classics were sent to the current generation, but not just like  that. The games have been completely rebuilt. The levels have been  redesigned and the gameplay has been redesigned from head to toe for the  N. Sane Trilogy. You will notice this immediately when you start the  game for the first time.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most  remasters these days are actually not very different from their  original appearance. Polished graphics and a higher resolution are  usually the things you have to do it with. This is not the case at all  with Crash Bandicoot. The new statues are specifically designed for the  current generation and look stunning. The difference between the  Playstation 4 version and Nintendo Switch version is surprisingly  minimal. By comparing both versions side by side, you can see that the  Playstation 4 is slightly sharper and that the lighting is a bit more  beautiful, but if you would not put the images next to each other, no  one would notice.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">A  great achievement from the Switch when you consider that most Switch  ports have to sacrifice a lot when it comes to image quality. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Apart from that, these ports all remain very impressive.</span></span></p><p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"></span></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><a href="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/crash-bandicoot-keyart-burst-final-1200x802.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="535" data-original-width="800" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/crash-bandicoot-keyart-burst-final-1200x802.jpg" /></a></span></span></div><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><br />&nbsp;</span></span><br /><p></p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ideal handheld game</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  biggest advantage of the Nintendo Switch is of course the portability.  You can take the device with you wherever you go and now let Crash  Bandicoot be the ultimate one to take advantage of this portability. The  whole trilogy is built on the same concept: Compact levels that get  progressively more challenging. A level from this trilogy lasts no more  than a few minutes (unless you keep going down). This makes this game  ideal for playing on the train, bus, car (as a passenger), or wherever.  You won't have to be glued to your screen for hours like with Skyrim,  but you can take the Switch out of your pocket to run through a level or  four while you quietly wait until you arrive at your destination.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> As soon as you're home, slide the Switch into the dock and you can  happily continue where you left off to finish the last levels of a  certain field.</span></span><br /></p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Verdict</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Crash  Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy does a perfect job on Nintendo's hybrid  console and even better than expected in most cases. Where many ports  have difficulty with the power of the device to visually give little,  Crash Bandicoot shows that it is indeed possible to compete with the big  boys from Sony and Microsoft. Graphically it is not a wonderful game,  but everything looks very sleek and beautiful. Both in handheld mode and  via the TV, the game plays just as well and the Nintendo Switch is, in  my opinion, the console to play Crash Bandicoot on if you don't already  own the trilogy. If you already own the game for the Playstation 4, Xbox  One, or PC, the Switch version offers nothing new (apart from  portability).Since Nintendo consoles are usually the first choice when  it comes to platformers, this is a nice addition to the Switch library.</span></span><br /> <span style="color: #ff7f00;"><b><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pros</span></span></b></span></p>           <ul class="fa-ul" style="list-style: outside none none;"><li><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Portable</span></span></li><li><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Performance</span></span></li><li><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Graphic</span></span></li><li><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Not full priced!</span></span></li></ul>           <p><b><span style="color: #ff7f00;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Negatives</span></span></span></b></p>           <ul class="fa-ul" style="list-style: outside none none;"><li style="list-style-type: none;">             <ul class="fa-ul" style="list-style: outside none none;"><li><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Amiibo support would have been nice</span></span></li></ul> </li></ul><div id="tap-translate"></div>
