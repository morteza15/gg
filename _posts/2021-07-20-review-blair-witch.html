<div dir="ltr"><h4><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Recently </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I wrote</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> about my surprises at Gamescom and Blair Witch was definitely one of the highlights. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Does the final game still scare me?</font></font></span></h4>            <p><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   1996, a boy disappears into the woods, two years after the film Blair   Witch. It&#39;s not really your job to look for him and to the   dissatisfaction of your colleagues you do. You arrive at the meeting   point and they have already left without you. When you go into the woods   you will hear over the radio that they have already searched there.   Eventually you will find new clues with the help of your dog, Bullet.   After a while you thunder down a hill and later you wake up in the dark.   You soon notice that there is more to this forest than you might   initially think.</font></font></span></p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/b_lfE2IeR2A/maxresdefault.webp" width="546" height="307"><br><br><p><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"></span></p><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"></span><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"></span><p><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Of   course you play this game in the dark with a headset on. Blair Witch   should have been released a little later in the year, now I had to wait   until nine o&#39;clock every night, because playing with the curtains closed   isn&#39;t the same after all. You investigate some clues and let Bullet   search around. Slowly your hair stands up a little further. You shine   around with your flashlight, but feel really naked behind you. Bullit   starts to growl and runs around you. Your heart starts beating faster   and then…</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">What   a game like this must have is the constant feeling of being watched,   like you&#39;re not alone and Blair Witch succeeds very well in this. You   have a few tools, a flashlight, your radio and phone, and a camera. You   can never use two at the same time and when you are busy with something,   the world around you just goes on. The camera also has several   functions. You will find video tapes that you can play and influence the   world around you. You want to go through a door somewhere that is   closed and you have a tape on which someone goes through the door. Put   the tape on pause at that moment and suddenly the door is open in the   real world. It also serves as an infrared or night camera, similar to   Outlast.</font></font></span></p>                        <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <p><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Sure,   it&#39;s a gimmick, but one that works well and the game doesn&#39;t last long   enough to get tired of it. Blair Witch is short, very short. Take two or   three evenings and you&#39;ll be done. For thirty euros I do not expect a   campaign of eighty hours, but something longer than this is allowed.   That said, there isn&#39;t a lot of unnecessary stuffing in there. You do   have to search here and there, but that&#39;s part of it. You are and feel   lost in this dark forest.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   gameplay is simple but effective. The controls are very simple. Walk,   click here and there and control the bullet. This helps a lot to imagine   yourself in the world of Blair Witch in a short time. As I said it is   best to play the game in the dark and with a headset on. With a headset   you also hear the good sound design even better. The crackling of the   twigs and leaves under your feet or the wind through the bushes and   trees, the sounds of the atmosphere changing around you and things that   may or may not be near you.</font></font></span></p><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"></span><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"></span><p><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game looks good, graphically it is occasionally a picture and the effects are nice. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">At other times, especially if you take a closer look, you see that more could have been done with texture quality, for example. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But overall the presentation is really fine. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Performance is a slightly different story. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The frame rates are somewhat unstable and you will encounter glitches here and there. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Such as suddenly being stuck in the environment or Bullet in a &#39;loop&#39;. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The only thing you can do is reload a save. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This can sometimes set you back quite a bit, of which I even had to repeat over ten minutes of gameplay once. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Fortunately this only happened occasionally.</font></font><br></span> <span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"></span></p>            <h3><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></span></h3>            <p><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Fans   of horror games can indulge themselves here. Are games like Outlast,   Slender, Alien Isolation and Layers of Fear (from the same makers) your   thing? Then you really shouldn&#39;t pass up Blair Witch, you don&#39;t need to   know anything about the lore either. The game is certainly not perfect.   Glitches, short stories and mediocre graphics keep Blair Witch somewhat   back. This does not take away from the fact that now and then my hair   slowly stood on end when it became very exciting. The pace is good and   there is little down time. Sometimes you really long for the moments   when it&#39;s daytime. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Thirty   euros is quite steeply priced for a game of this length, but well worth   it. In addition, it will be regularly on offer. If it is less than ten   or fifteen euros, I say buy immediately.</font></font><br></span> <span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><em><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I&#39;m scared to close my eyes, I&#39;m scared to open them…</font></font></em><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> Blair Witch is available for </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Xbox One</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> and </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Steam</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> . </font></font></span></p></div>
