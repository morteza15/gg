Red Dead Redemption 2   is set in America, circa 1899. You are a ferocious cowboy named Arthur   Morgan and you belong to a well-known gang. The van der Linde gang is   one of many and after a failed robbery you are chased by other gangs and   there is a spicy bounty on your head. Lose yourself in train   robberies, cowboy stand-offs and more under-the-radar chores to fund   your camp and gang. Make the right choices to make your camp the best   for the other members of the group. You can also go on an adventure in   the wilderness of America and you can search different areas for special   animals.Hunt the biggest bears or tame the most beautiful horses to get   money, or to get a beautiful horse. With the huge open world you can   lose yourself in the game for hours. Catching and training horses,   fishing or just discovering villages and towns, it&#39;s all possible!

All on ultra or on   high (when ultra wasn&#39;t an option) so I could get the most out of the   game. And it did run, with the occasional stalling. This especially   happened when something unexpected happened or when you were in the   middle of a snow storm. Which happens quite a lot in the beginning of   the game… The game also struggled with water. Fortunately, I was able to   play the game reasonably well and empathize with the group members of   the corridor who were suffering from the cold. However, this event has a   large share in my final score of the game.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Because the game is also out on the PlayStation 4, and I also have it at my disposal, I was therefore able to compare it well. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">How are the PC graphics compared to the PlayStation 4 Pro? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I must admit that I really prefer to play it on the PlayStation. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I feel much more like he&#39;s done there. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The cut scenes are nicer, the details sharper and the overall picture much more spectacular. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Like her for example, with the PC version it reminded me of the old Assassins Creed games like Brotherhood. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Where the hairs weren&#39;t loose yet and it was more placard wigs than loose hairs. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Adding to that, of course, that the PlayStation version never crashes and you can enjoy Red Dead Redemption 2 there for hours.</font></font></span></p><h3><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></span></h3>            <p><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit" class="gmail-">I&#39;m   pretty sure that all bugs will be fixed on the PC. But I can understand   for the people who have spent a lot of money and have waited a long   time for the PC release that they feel very bad. Still, there are people   who have no problem running the game, which is of course great news!   However, I hope that the server problem, or the specs problems will be   gone soon.
