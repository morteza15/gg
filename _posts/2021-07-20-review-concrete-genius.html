<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">After four and a half years in development, Concrete Genie finally appears. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   game immediately impresses with the distinct art style and luminous   visuals that you will encounter a lot in your journey as a young artist.</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Concrete Genie was developed by Pixelopus in collaboration with Sony. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game is very similar to games like Flower in some aspects. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It is therefore not an intense action game although there is combat in it. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This is a soothing game with a story.</font></font></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Story</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Concrete   Genie puts you as a player in the shoes of Ash, a young artist who   wants to restore the beauty of his city. As you do this you will be on a   psychological journey with themes such as bullying and trauma. You will   therefore have to defend yourself against the bullies who will   constantly be after Ash. The paint in the game therefore works as a   metaphor in many places. Where the bullies pollute and darken the city,   you will brighten things up with your powers and creative impulses.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Ash is a withdrawn boy. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">He seems difficult to make contact with peers, who are also after him. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That is why he withdraws into his sketchbook in which he draws all kinds of creatures. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">When the bullies take his sketchbook and rip the pages out, your journey to restore the sketchbook begins. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">During that trip you will also bring the environment back to life. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">When you set out to collect the pages, you soon encounter a genius. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A genius is a creature that has come to life from a work of art. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The genius soon asks you to paint a colorful environment for him. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The genies will do this more often. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If you fulfill their wish, you unlock collectibles or save super paint powers.</font></font></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gameplay</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   painting is therefore the primary mechanic of the game. You can choose   to control your brush with motion controls or the control sticks. The   game can also be played in VR. You can choose from different stencils,   including grass or rain. These stencils will all have their own effect.   If you paint an apple, the genies will eat it. When you&#39;re building a   campfire, the genies will often take a moment to warm up by the fire.   This provides a simple mechanic that has a lot of effect on the   environment and therefore actually gives it a living feeling. Before you   know it, you&#39;ll be looking around to see a world of color.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">While   the stencils might be a bit disappointing for players who possess   artistic talents, this mechanic makes Concrete Genie accessible to those   of us who don&#39;t possess these talents. The lack of creative talents is   therefore no reason to pass up Concrete Genie. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Because   you will actually see your works of art again, that often gives the   motivation to make something really beautiful out of it. It&#39;s not an   intrusive command. As you find more pages, you will be able to create   more diverse works of art.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   genies that you will always bring to life are also becoming more and   more diverse. This ensures that you will really look for the   collectibles. If you collect a new page, you can sometimes give the   genies a new tail or a set of ears. Or of course a single ear. That&#39;s   entirely up to you here. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Because   you have a lot of interaction with the genies, it is a lot of fun to   make them as separate as possible. You&#39;ll eventually be able to choose   from cat or dragon-like genies, to genies that look more like a cloud or   squid. The genies will therefore have distinct personalities based on   how you portray them.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Concrete Genie picks up slowly and will not introduce you to the combat in the first part. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That&#39;s   really not a bad thing considering the combat plays in a typical action   game way and is far from the most interesting aspect in the game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You will be most occupied with running, climbing and of course the artwork. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The combat that occurs later in the game is not nearly as challenging as hoped. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game seems to be aimed at a more casual audience. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Those   who can condone the lack of challenge and the repetitive mechanics will   be immersed in a story that is told almost entirely through visuals.</font></font></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Visuals</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The charm and true power of Concrete Genie is really in the visuals. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">During your journey you will have to restore the city by turning the lights back on. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You do this by decorating nearby walls. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This   ultimately creates incredibly impressive luminous environments in which   the genies will do something special on almost every wall. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In addition to the artworks, the characters and the city you are in also have a charm that we rarely see in games. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Although there are 2 VR modes for the game, we have not been able to test them.</font></font></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Conclusion</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Concrete   Genie provides a unique experience with impressive visuals and   art-driven storytelling. The first part of the game plays much quieter   than the second part, when the combat makes its entrance and the tension   increases. This really creates a sense of progression in which your   powers will increase and your bond with the genies will grow stronger.   Without too much talking in the game, you will feel involved. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   unique story that focuses on empathy, self expression and self   discovery provides an inspiring message. This is definitely a good   game.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">While Concrete Genie isn&#39;t very long, there&#39;s still plenty to do in the game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Even after completing the game you will be able to keep collecting a whole bunch of collectibles. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">They really aren&#39;t worthless collectibles. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">These often consist of concept art pieces or extra pages, with new genies or features for genies from Ash&#39;s sketchbook.</font></font></p></div>
