Dragon Quest XI continues on a formula that works when properly   implemented, and the game does it wonderfully spectacularly. The combat   system is turn-based with a few fun twists and it feels old-school as   well as refreshing. The cinematics, the story, the graphics, everything   is right and everything feels refreshing at every step of the story. This   is no surprise, since we already indicated in our previous review for   the game that this is a must-play if you like the JRPG genre.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">As   an unnamed hero, you discover that you are the Luminary, a   reincarnation of a mythical hero that no one thought would ever return. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">it&#39;s up to you to fight the dark. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If you read it that way, this story sounds quite linear and no more special than an average other story. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However,   nothing could be further from the truth, given that the game has many   fun twists and retains its own style during your content trip. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Every time you come to a new village it feels like a pause, something to catch your breath. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Then you are thrown straight into a rollercoaster of emotions again. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The boss fights, puzzles, everything is right and feels nice and challenging and at the same time a relaxed experience. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But what about now on the Nintendo Switch?</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Perfect for the Switch</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   first thing I noticed after starting the game was how close the Switch   graphics are to the Playstation 4 variant. The game looks fantastic down   to the details. The cinematics also run well and even in the 720p   handheld I was still surprised with how beautiful the game is. This   started well, I immediately felt like continuing this second   playthrough. So I spent much longer on the game the first night than I   intended and lost myself in how great the game looked. This in   combination with the great gameplay and story were a relief. I didn&#39;t   think that among all these big titles coming out towards the end of   2019, this very game would hold me tight.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The enemy design is something that fits perfectly with the core Nintendo titles and mixes the playful with the dark. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This is an important thing for Nintendo Switch players, who more often like a playful mentality in their games. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Also   a nice addition is the 2D mode, you can play the game completely in   16-bit pixel art, and both versions deliver the same high-quality   gameplay. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If you want to live off a little nostalgia, this is possible in large sizes!</font></font><br> <br></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Except   for a few minor aspects, the Dragon Quest XI S variant is a great   addition to your Switch library and highly recommended by me. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Even if you&#39;ve already played the game, the 2D mode is still a cool mode to play handheld on your Nintendo Switch. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I can recommend the game to everyone and it is completely worth the price of submission! </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is refreshing and at the same time nostalgic and the story flows nicely. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Be sure to let us know what you think of the game in the comments below!</font></font></p></div>
