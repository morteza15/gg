<div dir="ltr"><p><strong><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">About a year and a half ago, fans of the Monster Hunter series got what we&#39;ve been waiting for. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A full Monster Hunter game on current gen consoles and a little later on PC as well. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Now we can rejoice once more to go hunting in Monster Hunter World Iceborne. </font></font></strong><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><br></font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For those who are not yet familiar with Monster Hunter World, this expansion is a good time to start the game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">With the Hunter Helper program, experienced players are rewarded when they help starting players.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">And   that may be necessary. Monster Hunter games are traditionally not the   easiest games. That is often the criticism that goes around about the   franchise. They are games that are not easy to learn and end up   requiring a lot of grinding. And it has been no different here. Players   in the base game could face tempered and arch tempered monsters. Those   who wanted to make the matching armor sets often had to fight the   gigantic monsters several times. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Still, Iceborne is doing something about it. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Iceborne&#39;s   story picks up where World left off. A lot of monsters seem to emigrate   and show strange behavior. That also ensures that a whole lot of new   monsters show up. So you will have to do something about that.</font></font></p><p><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Iceborne   adds a wide variety of new monsters with of course the flagship   monster: Velkhana. Velkhana is a new elder dragon with an ice type   element. Capcom has promised to come up with free updates for the   expansion. The first of these, the Rajang, has already been announced.   The new monsters also include a few subspecies of known monsters. These   are beings that have taken on a number of different qualities because   they exist in other areas. For example, the Anjanath gets an electric   version with the name Fulgur Anjanath. These monsters have a number of   new moves and therefore require a whole new strategy.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Where   Iceborne really comes into its own is the challenge. Monster Hunter   World mostly focused on accessibility for new players. The series was   not yet very popular in the west. Iceborne brings back the old   challenge. We get a new rank. The master rank. The monsters in these   quests hit harder, have more health and are a much bigger challenge. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Along   with the new rank quests, we also get the master rank equipment. Armor   sets get a new master variant and weapons can be further upgraded.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There   are also a number of new mechanics involved. First, we get expansions   to the clutch claw that allow players to ram monsters into walls or   weaken their limbs. In addition, a lot of new skills come into play.   Iceborne has chosen to make elemental damage more important, so it will   also inspire players to get started with new builds.</font></font></p><p><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   addition to the new monsters and new mechanics, a lot of endgame   content will be added. Players will be able to take on monsters in a   variety of ways that make it much easier to acquire rare or unique   items. This significantly lowers the grindy content of the game. That   doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll be done with the game anytime soon. Iceborne will   keep you busy for many hours. The story alone will give you a few days   of playing time. The endgame, of course, even more so. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Because   elemental damage has been boosted, you will have to spend a lot of time   putting together different builds. And that&#39;s what Monster Hunter is   all about in the end. Those who find the game challenging have in most   cases not prepared themselves properly.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   will have to put a lot of time and care into getting ready for the next   hunt and figuring out the elemental weakness or blights of the monsters   that await you. The research guide will help you with that. When you   have found enough traces and collected enough research, you will gain a   better understanding of what is effective. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That   way, Iceborne challenges new players in a way that might be a bit spicy   at the beginning. However, this appeals to longtime fans in a way where   World may have been a little too easy for Monster Hunter veterans. </font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">All   in all, Iceborne is packed with new content. From new monsters, new   maps, new items to of course the new equipment that, together with the   master rank quests, give a whole new dynamic to the game.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Iceborne   is the perfect opportunity for players new to Iceborne to get in on the   game. Note, however, that Iceborne cannot be played separately from the   base game. Players will have to buy both the base game and the   expansion. Fortunately, these are quite affordable. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Capcom   has therefore promised to continue to support Iceborne and Monster   Hunter World with free content for at least another year.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   short, Iceborne gives us everything we hoped for but didn&#39;t dare to   expect from an expansion. From impressive new monsters including some   intimidating elder dragons, to new environments and fantastic   soundtracks, to the new build capabilities, Iceborne gives veteran fans   the challenge they hoped for in master rank while also giving new   players an easy way to enlist the help of veterans.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"></font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Iceborne   fills in all aspects of what fans have been missing in Monster Hunter   World and will add much more with the arrival of new content. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The core gameplay remains the same, of course. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Anyone who has an aversion to the Monster Hunter games will not enjoy this expansion much. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However, those who have worked with the base game will only enjoy Iceborne. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Now   is a great time for newcomers to step in as the community is reviving,   grinding has become easier and the Hunter Helper feature is here to help   players.</font></font></p></div>
