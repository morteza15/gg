<p>&nbsp;</p><h3><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">After a ten-year absence from the PC platform, Madden NFL 19 has returned. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Electronic Arts gave us the chance to check out this game, of course we didn't turn it down!</span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Madden NFL games are made to really show the player how this popular American sport works. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There  are of course some mistakes here and there that have been taken over  from previous games, and the game will not come across as "new", yet  Madden NFL 19, with its Frostbite engine and attention-grabbing Longshot  story mode, is the best Madden NFL game to date.</span></span></p>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">A balance for both sides</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Madden  NFL has never looked or played better on the field. This is also mainly  because Electronic Arts uses a new system regarding the players, which  they call Real Player Motion. One of the biggest aspects of this system  is the new “one-cut” part. Ball carriers gain the ability to quickly  change direction and orbit around defenders with a small boost. Of  course that includes good moves, “hesitation moves” as they are called,  can make a big difference in crucial moments. This way you can still  save that small open piece. Running a daring run to reach those last  inches can make the difference between winning and losing.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course there has to be balance in the game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Similarly, new mechanics have been added to Madden NFL 19 for the defense. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you move your player at the right time during a snap, you can get him into position faster than usual. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This will increase your chances of stopping a play, possibly avoiding a touchdown. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">EA has been striving for some time to give players more control on the pitch. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This year they succeeded, even though the adjustments are miniscule. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">To give the game even more detail; </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">this year it is possible to perform your own celebration after a touchdown. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This can be an individual celebration or one with your team mates. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whether you spike the ball to stop time or score a touchdown, Madden NFL 19 gives you more control on the field.</span></span></p>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Better gameplay thanks to the Frostbite Engine</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Madden  NFL 19 is the second game to use EA's Frostbite engine and it pays off  as the game looks a lot better. Player models now look more alive, for  example: the player's sweat, the way a player falls and takes blows.  Even the weather and time of day are unique, so every time and weather  condition has its own feel. The sun that falls low on the stadium in the  evening, a heavy rain shower or even playing in the snow; all this  brings Madden NFL 19 more to life, almost like a live TV broadcast.  While the game looks good graphically, the gameplay still has its flaws.  There are stupid things like: a ball that disappears into the ground or  a player's arm that bends in the most disastrous ways. There are also  things we know from the FIFA games,like a ball flying into space after a  collision with a player. The public also has its problems from time to  time. The NFL games have (almost) always had these mistakes in them.  However, all these things have little or no impact on the gameplay.</span></span></p>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Comment where to cry</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Madden  NFL 19 also has strengths, the commentary is one of them. Brandon  Gaudin and Charles Davis return to the game, this time again with  excellent statements and knowledge about the game. Their mutual humor  also gives the game more depth, so you get the feeling that you are  watching a live match instead of a game. Their talk is about different  things: from knowledge of teams and players to food and Seinfeld  references. While Gaudin and Davis do a good job, the Texas high school  commentators from the Longshot story mode steal the show. They have  unique but humorous statements about everything from their opinion about  a choice of arrangement or supplying information. ESPN commentator  Jonathan Coachmen is also in the game. He has taken on the role as  pre-game and halftime host, replacing Larry Ridley.Coachman is an  enthusiastic commentator and fun to listen to, but he gets into the bits  that most gamers skip. Madden NFL 19's commentary is updated regularly,  giving people who play the game information about a team or player in  real life.</span></span></p>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Every unique fashion reworked</span></span></h4>           <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of the deepest modes of Madden NFL 19 is Franchise. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Last year's game also had this mode but it wasn't handled nicely. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This year the mode has been given a major update so that it always remains challenging. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Ultimate Team mode is also back, which we mainly know from FIFA. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">A mode where you can put together a team with the players you want. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Take on the weekly challenges or go on a warpath with your team to defeat other players online.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Longshot story mode is of course also back from Madden 18. This year it's called Longshot: Homecoming. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The story follows Devin Wade who is having a rough time at the Dallas Cowboys training camp. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The audio dialogues are very strong in this mode, so there are real actors. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Think for example of Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider or Jimmy Tatro. </span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Madden NFL 19 is a good football game that improves on last year's edition in almost every aspect. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are problems, of course, but there is no other game that represents the NFL as well as this one. </span></span><div id="tap-translate"></div>
