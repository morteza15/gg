<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit" class="gmail-">It took 18 years, but fans of the cult hit finally got to work on the third </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit" class="gmail-">installment</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit" class="gmail-"> in the </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit" class="gmail-">Shenmue series</font><font style="vertical-align:inherit" class="gmail-"> . </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">After a more than successful Kickstarter campaign, the fuss about the promised Steam keys, the time has finally come. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Then the question is: Was it worth the wait?</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">As a complete Shenmue noob, I take on the role of Ryo Hazuki, the main character in the story. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Yes, that&#39;s right. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I&#39;ve never played a Shenmue game before, so everything is new to me. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I was told that the story literally picks up where it stopped 18 years ago and I think that in itself is a good start. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A direct connection to the past so that you can pick up the story immediately. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In my case, start. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A nice start in itself, even if you haven&#39;t played the previous games. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I didn&#39;t feel like I was being left out. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Of course I miss a large part of the story, but the mystery also has something.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Back in time</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">So   Shenmue 3 picks up right where it left off 18 years ago, but the game   feels and plays exactly like a game from 18 years ago. You could almost   say that it is an HD version of a Playstation 2 game. Despite this, it   didn&#39;t bother me at all while playing. Where I normally get tired of   Japanese games with slow controls, limited freedom and chaotic UIs,   Shenmue 3 brought a kind of charm with it. Maybe because it&#39;s fan   service on an over 18 year old series, I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t quite   figure it out, but it all feels like it&#39;s supposed to be.</font></font></p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jfs81mGdmxo/maxresdefault.webp" width="546" height="307"><br><br><p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"></font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Sentences   are cut off halfway through and then continue in a different tone,   dialogues are quite awkward at all, with strange answers and an odd   translation here and there made from Japanese (I think), but again, it   didn&#39;t bother me. The game is also very slow and everything is pretty   much chewed in front of you, because you can&#39;t go in the wrong direction   and spend hours on the wrong track. Again, not disturbing and that&#39;s   because Shenmue is richly filled with meaningful content. Everything is   connected in one way or another.</font></font></p><p><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   addition to following the story, there are several activities to do in   Shenmue 3. Side jobs such as driving a forklift and chopping wood, mini   games, fishing, collecting plants, Kung Fu, gambling games and even   gachapon (capsule toy machines). </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Somehow, sooner or later you will qualify with these things and each and every one of them will help you further in the game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Whether it&#39;s money you need, or a specific item for a quest. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Everything is connected in one way or another. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This makes it hard to waste your time in Shenmue 3.</font></font><br> </p>                        <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A   very slow game, very viscous and in general the individual gameplay   elements are not particularly challenging. The perfect recipe to slide   me into another game after 5 minutes, but no. Shenmue does something to   me. While playing, I felt like turning back into a child for a while and   I completely lost the sense of time while playing Harvest Moon on the   GameCube. Completely zen. Since then I&#39;ve been looking for a game that   would have that effect on me, but without success. The HD version of   Harvest Moon on PS4 didn&#39;t. Stardew Valley didn&#39;t either. Shenmue 3,   despite being completely different in genre, did. Maybe it&#39;s because of   the slow, everything in due time mentality, but I don&#39;t really know.   Maybe it&#39;s the soothing soundtrack repeated in the background.There is   beautiful music in the game that only enhances that whole zen feeling.</font></font></p>            <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The Kung Fu Detective</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">While playing you are actually a kind of detective. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">During the story you are constantly looking for a certain person. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Such a person usually needs something from you, or refers you to another person. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Searching for objects there are several possibilities to move forward. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can ask residents if they happen to know more. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Every resident tells you something different, which makes you wiser or not. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Maybe you&#39;ve seen the item in a store before and already know where to find it.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However, certain items are not for sale and can be found by literally searching in cupboards, drawers or on shelves. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Other items are hidden in capsules in a gachapon machine and other items are obtained by playing minigames. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Everything is connected and the world around you moves with it. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Time passes by which people may no longer stand behind their stall in the evening. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Shenhua   will ask you almost every night how your day has been with Ryo telling   Shenhue different things depending on your progress in the story. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The mutual relationships and conversations, despite poor execution, are incredibly beautiful and carefully thought out.</font></font><br> <br></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Shenmue 3 is a game made with a lot of love and you can feel it. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The dated design is all manageable once you&#39;re working on the big picture. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It is not a difficult game, nor is it challenging, although it is a game where you have to be a little careful. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s a quiet, relaxing game that you definitely shouldn&#39;t rush through. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The vibrant world around you ensures that there is always something to do. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">So take your time, we have been waiting for the sequel for 18 years. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Who knows when the next part will appear. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Anyway, I&#39;ll go back to Shenmue and Shenmue II for a while. </font></font></p></div>
