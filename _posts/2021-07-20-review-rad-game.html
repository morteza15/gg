<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The 80s are all the rage. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Rightly so. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The era of neon colors and wild hair will always remain totally excellent. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">RAD is bursting with the 80s and references are everywhere. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But is RAD really as rad as the title makes you believe?</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Developer   Double Fine was founded by Tim Schafer, the man behind Full Throttle,   Grim Fandango and co-founder of Monkey Island. Their games are often not   for everyone, but they do have three things in common: unique gameplay,   their own style and quirky humor, and RAD also ticks all the boxes. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">RAD   is a Roguelike set in a post-post-apocalyptic world. So this world has   had bad luck not once, but even twice. The kids that remain have to   enter this dangerous landscape to keep the lights on, as it were. You   can choose from some of these stereotypical kids when you start a run.   You can play several of these freely, but as far as I have experienced   there is no difference between these kids outside of appearance.</font></font></p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jYFnZzMvaT0/maxresdefault.webp"><br><br>            <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You are dropped into a world that is randomly generated. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Everything is mutated because of all the RADIoactive radiation. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You are not told what to do and there is no tedious comprehensive tutorial. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You fight some enemies and see an XP-like bar filling up slowly. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You will also find cassette tapes everywhere and sometimes a five-and-a-quarter floppy. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There are several types of monsters, but not many yet. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You&#39;ll find some sort of statue here and there, some shoot a laser beam in a specific direction. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Of course you follow this and you will find a large door that you have to open, but you still have to turn on a laser. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Once you have done this, you can enter the dungeon. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">No specifics per se.</font></font></p>            <h3><span style="color:rgb(255,127,0)"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Mutations</font></font></span></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Mutations   are the real gameplay gimmick in RAD. You earn RADs for things like   killing enemies. Think of it as a kind of XP. When you fill your bar,   you get a random mutation. Each so-called Exo-mutation looks like it   doesn&#39;t feel good to the player but does give you a big advantage   afterwards. For example, you get a large purple arm that you can use as a   boomerang, a flaming head that you can throw at your enemy as a bomb,   or you can throw a trail of blubber behind you that does damage to   monsters. You can fire all ranged "weapons" as you would with a </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">twin-stick shooter</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> , which greatly improves the gameplay.</font></font><br> <img src="https://pic.gameich.com/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNEE_RAD.gif" alt="rad" class="gmail-alignnone gmail-size-full gmail-wp-image-56013" width="616" height="347"><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can also find or buy a mountain of Endo mutations. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">These   are the passive modification that, for example, ensure that you get an   elemental resistance, do more damage or can see secrets. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For both types there is a laundry list of mutations that you can unlock, making the combinations almost unlimited. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Where you can only use four of the Exo mutations at a time, the number of Endo mutations is unlimited.</font></font></p>            <h3><span style="color:rgb(255,127,0)"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">roguelike</font></font></span></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">RAD   is a roguelike. That is, each run is essentially a new game. The levels   are completely random, so you never know what to expect. At least   that&#39;s the intention. When you die you can start over. If you&#39;re dead,   you&#39;re dead. Everything you have earned is lost. You can deposit your   cassette tapes, or your money, for subsequent games between each level. I   have to admit that I&#39;m not a big fan of these genres. While some see it   as improving on your previous run, to me it feels more like you can   just start all over again.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That   doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t enjoy these kinds of games. I especially like   roguelikes where your games generally don&#39;t last longer than ten to   fifteen minutes. Games where the jars last more than an hour often lead   to the same problem, starting a new run is very tedious. You already   have to find your first items or upgrades while you are already quite   proficient in the game. For impatient people like me, this quickly   causes me to put my controller or mouse down again when I die. Where   roguelikes mainly rely on the &quot;oh, one more pot&quot; idea, this works   against RAD.</font></font><br> <img src="https://pic.gameich.com/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/klngms36cojfzjm5p3q1.jpg" alt="rad" class="gmail-alignnone gmail-size-full gmail-wp-image-56010" width="1920" height="1080"><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There are options to start runs with some mutations already active and more hearts. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This is what Double Fine clumsily calls "tools", which I translate as "easy mode". </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">RAD is quite a difficult game and these tools mainly ensure that the start of a run is a little easier and smoother. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Whether this is a useful and desirable addition is purely up to the player.</font></font></p>            <h3><span style="color:rgb(255,127,0)"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gameplay and presentation</font></font></span></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Style   clearly trumps graphics here. Which in itself is not bad, but the game   could have apparently run on an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3. Nevertheless,   RAD has heavy system requirements and does not run as well on a   standard Xbox One, PlayStation 4 or Switch as it should. Even your PC   needs at least a GTX 970, and Double Fine recommends GTX 980/1060. To be   clear: These requirements are higher than those of Battlefield V. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This   will be a result of all the (neon) effects that the game has, but still   I find it strange. Graphically, it&#39;s not as attractive as it could have   been.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The gameplay is again a case of just-not. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Fighting monsters isn&#39;t as satisfying as I&#39;d like to see. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s   nice that the RAD uses the twin stick controls, but combat is boring   and attacking an enemy isn&#39;t as satisfying as it should be. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Despite quickly figuring out the patterns of the monsters, the game feels very unfair later in a run. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It doesn&#39;t look like an increasing difficulty and more like the game saying &quot;it&#39;s enough now&quot;.</font></font><br> <img src="https://pic.gameich.com/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/arjeoawkr34h4mppzir8.png" alt="rad" class="gmail-alignnone gmail-size-full gmail-wp-image-56008" width="1600" height="900"></p>            <h3><span style="color:rgb(255,127,0)"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></span></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Despite   the nice gimmick of all the mutations, the game never really captivates   me, really grabs me. With every run I think half way through &quot;this is   pretty okay&quot;, only to die after an hour or so in a very unfair feeling. If I start again I can grind for half an hour to an hour before it   becomes fun again. So for every half hour of fun I spend an hour not   having fun. The humorous 80s style is equally fun, but it quickly adds   nothing and even bothered me here and there.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Ultimately, RAD leads to the net-not syndrome. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There&#39;s nothing about the game that I can say is really bad, but there&#39;s also nothing that really grabs me. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It seems that Double Fine started with a gimmick and only put a game around it. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If   you&#39;re really a fan of roguelikes, 80s style and silly humor, then   you&#39;ll have quite a few hours of fun with the game and two bucks isn&#39;t a   bad entrance fee. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For all other gamers, I don&#39;t think the game will leave an impression. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">RAD is available for </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">PC</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> , </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Xbox One</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> , </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">PlayStation 4</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> and </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Switch</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> . </font></font></p></div>
