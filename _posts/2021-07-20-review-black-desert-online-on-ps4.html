<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Our </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">original review</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> for Black Desert Online talked about what a wonderful game we received from Pearl Abyss. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Can the Playstation 4 version match the PC version? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This time we won&#39;t go into detail about the features of the game, but purely on our impression of the PS4 variant!</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Black Desert Online is known as a great MMORPG full of unique and original features. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For   many, the game is disadvantaged by an overpriced cash shop and an   eternal grind for gear, which you have to achieve through heavy RNG. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Other than that, BDO is certainly the most beautiful graphically in its genre and the remastered version looks breathtaking. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But, these are all familiar aspects. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">How does the game actually run on console? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">We know the Xbox version caused mixed reactions, is the Playstation client a better story?</font></font></p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/qsf4Plkj28w/maxresdefault.webp" width="546" height="307"><br><br>            <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">graphics</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Something Black Desert is known for is having great graphics and extensive character customization. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Unfortunately, you notice a big difference in the Playstation version with the remastered UHD version on PC. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This shouldn&#39;t be a problem, but the textures on this console don&#39;t do the game much good. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game itself looks fine, but just lacks that flair that the PC version brings, also for the graphical upgrade. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If you&#39;ve never touched the PC client, luckily this difference won&#39;t hit you that hard and the game looks pretty nice. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Unfortunately,   MMOs on consoles are still a poor concept, but games like The Elder   Scrolls Online, Neverwinter and now also BDO are raising the bar. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Graphically, so a mixed reaction from us, not bad, but not great either.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gameplay</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Apart   from some minor bugs, the game plays nicely on PS4. Pearl Abyss handles   the complex combat well by using the Dualshock Controller to its   highest potential and there is very little to complain about in this   area. The UI could have been a little better, but that is partly   forgiven as the game contains an eternal set of menus and features. The   community is still very active in this and we hope it will continue to   be so.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">We were of course at Gamescom this year and we were able to participate in the BDO PS4 launch party. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">During this party we were the first in the world to hear that several expansions will come to the console version this year. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There are no exact dates yet, but the gameplay will improve significantly with the arrival of new features, areas and more! </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Pearl   Abyss wants to make the game more successful than it was on Xbox in the   beginning, hopefully they learned from some small mistakes.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The big bad world</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Black Desert has an immense world and as we just said it will be expanded at a rapid pace. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Fortunately, the game plays smoothly and the performance can certainly be with the big world in mind. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The challenge is also more present, as the base game offers a bit more challenge than the game with expansions. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">All in all, it&#39;s a smooth experience with a high fun factor. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">After hours of playing I didn&#39;t even realize it was almost morning and this is a good sign. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It took me back to the time when I first got my hands on the PC version. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I&#39;m curious how they will tackle the actual desert and elf territory!</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">We already knew the game, but this PS4 version brings out many good aspects of the PC version. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Unfortunately, the game is a tad underpowered by graphics and some game-breaking teething problems. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Fortunately, these are all solvable problems and we hope the developers will continue to be active in improving the game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For the price, this title is well worth it, especially if you&#39;ve been missing an MMO on your console all these years. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Will we see you online?</font></font></p></div>
