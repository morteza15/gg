Think of it as an adventure game too. Why am I saying this? Well, you're  following a story, broken down into sub-stories. You follow two  characters, Rob and Tib, as you progress through the story mode. These  two 'characters' are not only in for a silly joke, but want to save  different kinds of 8 and 16 bit games from a number of bugs. How do you  do that? Shake that booty! During this story you will encounter many  nonsensical but very funny moments. The formula works a bit the same as  with Guitar Hero. You have your arrows, or function keys (Switch), to  hit certain colors at the right times.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You  use your trigger buttons to hit certain drums. You have the choice to  play more than 50 different songs, divided into games such as&nbsp; </span></span><em><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pokémon&nbsp;</span></span></em><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </span></span><em><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Metal Gear Solid</span></span></em><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . The story mode is funny, fanatical and works fantastic. Not only do  you play the music, but you also follow a solid story that can grab your  heart sometimes with some emotional moments.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You  can play the game with up to four people, co-op or versus (online).  With over 50 chiptune songs and multiple difficulty levels, the  replayability is quite high. The game is also quite addictive and I kept  shouting; 'oh, one more level then…' The music is also quite unique,  they are adapted versions of official songs, with some actual songs  mixed in. The music was composed by Dubmood, Zabutom, Hello World,  Yponeko and LePlancton. Those names will mean something to music  connoisseurs! Not every song was equally great to play, but hey, tastes  differ.</span></span><br /> <br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Achieving  combos actually gives a sense of completeness, as it is an achievement  to 'play' the songs completely flawlessly the first time. You will  really have to memorize the levels to get the highest scores. The game  is quite challenging and will frustrate you a lot on higher difficulty  levels. The highest degree was almost impossible, even after several  hours of play. This is because you are working with an 'hp' bar. If you  miss your buttons too often, you will lose health points. If the bar  reaches 0, it's game over.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  nice thing is that Rob and Tib wear an outfit in every game that also  fits that piece, those outfits are not always… socially accepted. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">But hey, laugh anyway! </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">OSM is truly a trip through your childhood, I promise you that. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course the game is not perfect and there are some annoying things here and there, but nothing worth writing about. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The developers have said there will be more levels to come, so brace yourself.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Verdict</span></span></h4>           <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is not much to say about Old School Musical, the formula and the idea is quite simple. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">All in all, the game is extremely addictive, and for the price of 13 Euros, it is well worth picking up. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's hard to find such good games for this money, and that alone gives the game a higher score. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The replayability is very high and playing together with friends is super fun. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">When I let him play some friends, they all wouldn't stop. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">For a small studio, this says a lot! </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Keep making games like this so I can keep wasting hours on it! </span><span class="" style="vertical-align: inherit;">OSM is not only playable on Nintendo Switch, but is also available on Steam, starting today! </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fancy a fun, simple game? </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hop on the train! </span></span><p>&nbsp;</p><div id="tap-translate"></div>
