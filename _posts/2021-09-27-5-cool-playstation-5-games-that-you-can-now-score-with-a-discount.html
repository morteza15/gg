But with this discount, it&#39;s a great racing game. Speed ​​through the different worlds and be the first to cross the finish line. In addition, good use is made of the DualSense controller, so that you feel good about what kind of surface you are driving. Finally, it is also possible to create your own circuits and share them with others.

Yet I have included it in this list of PlayStation 5 games with a discount. You can now score the game for a tenner. And that&#39;s not really money. For that you get a somewhat outdated platform game with some flaws. But for this amount you can probably see through that.
