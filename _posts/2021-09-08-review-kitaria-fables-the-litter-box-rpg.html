<h4>Kitaria Fables is a brand new cute RPG in which you take the lead role as a four-legged friend. On your way through the world you cross different types of animals, cities, areas, enemies and much more.</h4><p> Kitaria Fables is an RPG where you can play your own cat. You ate out with weapons that you can strengthen, tools for your crops, and spells. The eye also wants something and that is why there are different types of harnesses, costumes and accessories for sale and to make. It has the important features of the RPG, although it is very light. No system is very comprehensive. This makes Kitaria Fables a great RPG for the novice RPG player and it might even be an excellent game to get acquainted with the genre, with the emphasis here being very much on the least favorite features of the RPG genre.</p><p> <img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kitaria-Fables_20210906201734-scaled.jpg"></p><h2> The dark side of the coin</h2><p> Kitaria Fables has got the core of the RPG well in the sense that nothing comes to you. You have to work for all the little things, be it a new armor, weapon, tool, spell or crop. It&#39;s all going to take you some time. Something that in principle is self-evident. Every step you take in the world of Kitaria Fables has a certain &#39;grind&#39;. Completing a quest, crafting a new sword, or learning a new spell. You have to grind for something every time, even if you play the game at a very slow pace.</p><p> Many quests, main or side quests, consist of collectibles. For example, you need to collect different types of ores to repair a bridge. You can mine these ores from rocks, but you don&#39;t see them much. Fortunately, at that moment the game shows you how best to get a certain type of material. For example, go to a certain type of area and defeat a certain type of monster here, because they drop a lot of ores when they die. About 90% of the game consists of completing these collectibles to complete quests. The example of the bridge even consisted of 4 collectibles, which obviously extends the time of the game considerably, although you are working on not really exciting content.</p><p> It also doesn&#39;t help that your character doesn&#39;t have its own level. Getting stronger in this game depends on equipment. Let it be true that fortifying your equipment is also a time-consuming process of gathering materials. The same materials you need to progress through the story or side quests. An endless grind.</p><p> <img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kitaria-Fables_20210906200646-scaled.jpg"></p><h2> Variation in a small RPG</h2><p> Luckily you don&#39;t spend hundreds of hours grinding for a special sword during the ride. The game itself is about 20 hours long and a little longer if you want to collect everything and also want to do all the side quests. During the ride you are actually always collecting, but fortunately there is some variation in it. As for the brevity of the game, you are also very free to do it at your own pace and order. Although some areas are closed until you progress through the story, the game has a happy and healthy relationship between must and may. If you want to grind your sword to a certain level first, or earn a lot of money by growing crops first, you can.</p><p> <img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kitaria-Fables_20210904213727-scaled.jpg"></p><p> Do you want to assemble a certain type of armor or accessory before continuing with the story? Usually you get a long way before needing materials from further areas. Since collecting everything takes a lot of time, you are not constantly busy with the same thing, because this is simply not fun. Growing crops is mainly automatic. It takes a few days before your crops are fully grown, so in the meantime you hardly have to look at them and you can continue with one of the many assignments.</p><p> In addition to the variety, the diversity unfortunately also has a number of obvious disadvantages.</p><h2> Quantity over quality?</h2><p> Despite being very concise, Kitaria Fables has a lot of variety in things you can do. There are many different types of enemies, items, locations and materials. Materials usually come from one specific enemy in a specific location. It&#39;s great that there is so much to do and see. Especially during the first few hours of the game, I was pleasantly surprised by the many different things that came my way.</p><p> <img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kitaria-Fables_20210905213856-scaled.jpg"></p><p> The downside to this, however, is that nothing feels exceptional. Growing any crop is actually exactly the same. Plant, water and wait to harvest. Combat is very simple and actually has no challenge or depth at all. Attacks from enemies are always easy to avoid. A red shaded area around the enemy, or line, indicates an attack is imminent. Simply not being in the red area will prevent you from taking damage. You can also choose to roll into the red area just before the attack, even then you will not take any damage.</p><p> Furthermore, the collection of raw materials and materials is also very limited. You obtain materials either from monsters in specific areas, or by chopping rocks and trees around your village. To make spells, you need orbs with the same element as the spell. You make these orbs by exchanging certain stones for such an orb. These stones are dropped by many different enemies, so you have to grind for this too.</p><p> <img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kitaria-Fables_20210904205916-scaled.jpg"></p><h2> Verdict</h2><p> Kitaria Fables looks cute, looks quite deep and fascinating at first glance, but once a few hours later it turns out to be very one-sided and repetitive. A seasoned RPG fan will benefit little from playing this cute cat RPG. Kitaria Fables therefore seems to be really made for a younger target group that wants to get a taste of the RPG genre. It forms a great foundation for the RPG genre in which players are introduced to an increasing difficulty in which they determine the pace and challenge themselves by refuting the focus on progress, amplification, collecting and so on.</p><p> With the help of proverbial training wheels it is therefore a very accessible RPG for a younger audience, in which you can taste the variation within the genre, but certainly also the less interesting grind pieces. A great warm up for the future Dragon Quest player!</p><p> The post Review: Kitaria Fables – The Litter Box RPG appeared first on Gameich.com .</p>
