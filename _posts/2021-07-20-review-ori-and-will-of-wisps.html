<div dir="ltr"><h4><span style="vertical-align:inherit">There are some of those games that take you in the atmosphere from A to Z. Games like Journey are so immersive in atmosphere that you actually forget that you are gaming. We already knew from the first part of Ori that this is just such a game. Now that Ori is back with Ori and the Will of the Wisps, we couldn&#39;t wait to get back on a cloud and fly through the game. But luckily you can also play the game with a lot of challenges, of course it depends on what you like as a player.</span></h4>  <p><img class="gmail-aligncenter gmail-size-full gmail-wp-image-58994" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ori7.jpg" alt="Ori and the Will of the Wisps" width="1907" height="1040"><br><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a delightfully immersive platform game from Moon Studios. The game runs on two things: atmosphere/music and platforming. Just like the previous part, the story and game is accompanied by fantastic music. Every part of the forest, every moment in the game has its own number that fits the situation. The music is beautiful to listen to song by song. It is therefore recommended to play the game at practically max. volume. The carefully chosen music replaces the emptiness of the sparse conversations in the game. But to be honest, I don&#39;t find that disturbing at all.</span><br><img class="gmail-aligncenter gmail-size-full gmail-wp-image-58996" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ori2.jpg" alt="Ori and the Will of the Wisps" width="1900" height="1038"></p>  <h3><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Up and down Platformer</span></h3>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">The other part of this great game is the platform part. Ori and the Will of the Wisps has adjusted the game area quite a bit compared to its previous game. There&#39;s a little bit of RPG in the menu now. You can select new skills and attacks and make them stronger. You can also use and compose various power-ups. In addition, you have a small recovery work that you can perform in the forest. The game can be played on both the PC and the Xbox and therefore with a controller or keyboard and mouse. I prefer to play platformers with a controller and you notice that with this game. With the controller you can perform certain jumps and actions just a little better than with your keyboard.</span><br><img class="gmail-aligncenter gmail-size-full gmail-wp-image-58995" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ori5.jpg" alt="Ori and the Will of the Wisps" width="1900" height="1029"><br><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Nevertheless, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is very playable with keyboard and mouse. The only thing you have to keep in mind is that you play the game in full screen. When you play windowed you will regularly click with your mouse next to the screen and the game will automatically pause. The advantage of playing with the mouse and keyboard is that some aiming actions are just a bit more accurate than you can do with your controller. Ultimately, of course, it comes down to your personal preference. Fortunately, you only have to purchase the game once and you can play it on both Xbox and PC.</span></p>  <h3><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Beautiful story</span></h3>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">The story of Ori and the Will of the Wisps is another one that will have you sitting on the edge of your desk chair. The story picks up where Ori and the Blind Forrest ended. Out of the egg spawns a little owl named Ku. This is the daughter of Kuro, the hostile owl from Blind Forrest. Ori and his friends take care of Ku. However, Ku has a deformed wing. As a result, Ku cannot fly while she can see all the other birds flying around her. Ori comes up with a solution and gives Ku a feather from her mother. Once the feather is attached to her wing, Ku can finally fly. Ori and Ku fly together and get caught in a storm. Here they get separated and it&#39;s up to Ori to find Ku again.</span><br><img class="gmail-aligncenter gmail-size-full gmail-wp-image-58997" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ori3.jpg" alt="Ori and the Will of the Wisps" width="1904" height="1028"><br><span style="vertical-align:inherit">In this new forest, new challenges and monsters await Ori. But new friends are also made in Ori and the Will of the Wisps. As the game progresses the more you will learn about the state of this forest. Together with your new friends, you search for Ku and a way to save the forest from the evil spirits that haunt it. Along the way you will learn new and well-known skills that were also in the previous part. With various friends you can learn upgrades and new skills. You will also have to search for certain skills in the forest to get to a new piece.</span></p>  <h3><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict Ori and the Will of the Wisps</span></h3>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Ori and the Will of the Wisps is another brilliant game from Moon Studios. The game has three difficulty levels to play. For the story lovers you can set the game on easy and for the seasoned platformer you can set the game on hard. The story is well put together with some twists in the story. The music that accompanies this game is again of a high level. Each song fits the environment or situation you find yourself in. Whether you play the game on PC or on Xbox, the game can be played well on both. It ultimately comes down to personal preference. With the controller you just notice that you can make certain jumps just a little better than with your keyboard. On the other hand, the aiming actions with your mouse and keyboard are slightly more accurate than with the controller.</span><br><span style="vertical-align:inherit"> In short, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a wonderful game to play and it won&#39;t surprise me if they manage to win x number of prizes again this year.</span><br><img class="gmail-aligncenter gmail-size-full gmail-wp-image-58998" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ori4.jpg" alt="Ori and the Will of the Wisps" width="1883" height="1016"></p>  <div id="gmail-tap-translate"> </div>  <div id="gmail-tap-translate"> </div></div>
