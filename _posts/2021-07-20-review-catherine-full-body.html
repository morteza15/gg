<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit" class="gmail-">Catherine Full Body is an updated version of the 2011 original. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However, anyone expecting a simple remaster is wrong. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">According to Atlus, the social and political climate in 2011 did not allow some topics to be discussed in the game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That&#39;s different now. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That is why there is a new character, and also a whole new branch in the story.</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Catherine Full Body remains pretty much the same in gameplay. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The structure of the game remains mostly the same. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You will have to climb your way to the top of a collapsing tower made up of blocks. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Why? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Easy. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The whole thing takes place in your nightmares. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If your character dies in his dream, he is also a thing of the past in the physical world.</font></font></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Story</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   once again assume the role of Vincent. Vincent is not a very remarkable   character and that is perhaps the intention. The players must be able   to put themselves in Vincent&#39;s problems. Hopefully we don&#39;t do that too   much. Vincent is in fact a man in his 30s who has gotten himself into a   lot of trouble. He has been in a long-term relationship with his   girlfriend, Katherine. Until one day he is approached and wakes up next   day next to Catherine. Yes, with a C. Catherine does not see it as a one   night stand but as a declaration of love. Vincent is no longer able to   shake her off.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That&#39;s   where Catherine&#39;s full body still matches the story in the original   game. In this new version, however, a new character will be added. In a   scene where she is being chased, we get to know Rin. Rin is a young lady   who has lost her memory and is rescued by Vincent. Since she doesn&#39;t   know who she is or where she comes from, Vincent gets her a job at the   Stray Sheep, the bar where Vincent and his friends can be found every   day. Rin comes to live next door to Vincent. From there everything gets   out of hand. Vincent faces a lot of choices that will have a major   impact on his life.Does he end the affair with Catherine and ultimately   choose to stay with Katherine? To marry her? Or does Vincent choose to   go through life as a single? Would he perhaps leave his old flame behind   for the new Catherine who looks like his ideal wife? Could he be   discovering feelings for the innocent and much calmer Rin?</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You as a player will have to choose which way the story goes on the basis of a number of options and questions. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That is not always so clear. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">What   choices and how these choices affect the story and where you have the   opportunity to go in a different direction are not assigned to you. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">So you will have to choose yourself. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That is often the hardest part of the game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Do you pick the answers you think are correct or are you simply honest? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You will have to play through the game several times to experiment with the options and different storylines. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This makes the story a lot more complex as there are a lot of new choices and also a number of new endings. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Anyone who thinks this is a simple puzzle game is wrong.</font></font><br> <br></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gameplay</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Between   puzzle levels you will have to focus on interacting with people around   you and you will be confronted with a lot of choices and questions that   have a major impact on the lives of others, as well as the direction of   the story. The gameplay is mixed well and this is where Catherine Full   Body draws her strength from. This is a unique game with unique story   elements. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It   really isn&#39;t a game that you play through once. After the credits,   you&#39;ll most likely start over right away to explore the other endings.   So these are very different. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However,   the game contains a lot of cutscenes. If you&#39;re waiting for an   action-packed game, this is not the place to be. It really is a story at   first.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Those who have had enough of that story can get started with the multiplayer in Catherine Full Body. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This is in fact much more present than before. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Players   can compete in couch co-op mode in the Colosseum or in the Online Arena   (both alone and in co-op) against other players. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In addition, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Catherine Full Body is perhaps best described as an interactive animation. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can finish the game in about two days, but that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ve had the full experience given the many endings. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   addition to the main story line, the people (who you see in your dreams   as sheep) around you also suffer from nightmares and they all have   their own problems and stories. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Your choices will also determine their fate.</font></font></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game is still just as difficult as the original but luckily comes with the safety mode. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Players who are not ready for the frenzy of Catherine Full Body will still be able to experience the story. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However, you&#39;ll find that this is a game that tests your thinking skills and also ensures that you get better quickly. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">And that feels good. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In addition, the story tests your views and asks a number of critical questions that will also make you think. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game is also packed with a lot of quotes, trivia and other little things that are fun to pick up.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The addition of Rin sometimes feels a bit over the top but in the end it works out well. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   ability to choose a whole new path for Vincent also makes you as a   player think about the limits, problems and benefits of love, marriage   and life itself.</font></font></p></div>
