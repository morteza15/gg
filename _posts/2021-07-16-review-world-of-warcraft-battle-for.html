<p>&nbsp;</p><h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Battle For Azeroth is the latest expansion for the most popular MMORPG in history: World of Warcraft. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This expansion focuses first on the battle of Lordearon. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Horde has settled here in the Undercity and the Alliance wants to take back Lordearon. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">After this battle, both factions look for reinforcements.</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">One  of the selling points of the new expansion are the Allied Races. If  players had already pre-ordered Battle For Azeroth during Legion, they  were already allowed to get started with some of these Allied Races. The  new expansion expands on this and adds more races. More Allied Races  will be added over time including the Zandalari Trolls for the Horde and  Kul Tiran Humans for the Alliance. Of course it doesn't stop there and  the levels are raised to 120. Artifact weapons are thrown in the trash  and it is time for an Artifact amulet. This amulet contains the heart of  Azeroth will grow stronger as players collect Azerite. This is the new  form of Artifact Power in Battle For Azeroth.A higher level amulet  allows you to equip your Azerite armor with different perks depending on  the armor and your specialization.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bye Legion!</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Finally! </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">To  be fair, the whole Legion theme was fun in the beginning because  Burning Legion Hype, but I'm so glad we're rid of all that green gunk. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It  literally popped out of my head and that's why I'm really looking  forward to the new expansion because it all looks really beautiful. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The new areas are very varied and share a super cool theme. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zandalar is all about mountains, jungles, swamps, ancient temples and dinosaurs. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">I mean, what more could you want? </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">THERE ARE DINOS! </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is also a super cool new mount! </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This unfortunately costs 5,000,000 gold. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">I'll be here long she lives will never come close so no Brutosaur mount for me. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Check out how fat it is below:</span></span><br /> </p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">On to 120</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It  will take you several hours to make your way through the new areas to  reach level 120, but unlike the previous expansion, it's less arduous  this time. There is a very nice story baked into the quests that you  play. Of course the quests still consist of: Kill x number of these  beasts. Collect x amount of this stuff. Talk to this man and then talk  to these 3 men in order. But I don't mean this. You have chapters in  each area, and each chapter tells its own sub-story and together it  forms a whole. The previous expansions already did this, but in Battle  For Azeroth it works better in my opinion.</span></span><br /> <br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's  not just a number of quests that you have to complete in a certain area  before you get a cutscene and have completed a certain chapter, but the  quests themselves have a logical order that slowly shapes the story. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You work your way from point A to point B in a certain area and the area around you slowly forms with the actions you perform. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In  this way, the standard mmo quests are a lot less annoying to do because  it doesn't seem endless but there is indeed a progress to be seen. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">I had not experienced this with the previous expansions and I thought this was very nice to see in Battle For Azeroth.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Beautiful environment</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">I  can't say it enough, but the environments in these expansions are  magnificent. The game may look outdated compared to other modern mmo's,  but you can completely see through this. It does have a certain charm  that conquers you. In my opinion, this is the best expansion ever with  Mists of Pandaria in second place. The variation in areas with a nice  cohesion and whole is very special and especially the densely wooded  jungles and swamps have a very cool vibe. You can really feast your eyes  on this extension for hours and enjoy the different views. In addition,  there are also appropriate ambient sound effects that make you feel  like you're walking around in Jurassic Park at times.</span></span><br /> <br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">At least this applies to the Horde during leveling. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">I  didn't level up an Alliance character from 110 to 120, so I only  discovered the areas of Kul Tiras through the War Campaign and the World  Quests after 120. These areas also look interesting so far, but have a  very different atmosphere and appearance than Zandalar. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kul Tiras tends more towards a Pirate Cove-like setting. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Buildings made of shipwrecks and stark grassy plains between medium-high mountains with a village here and there.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Endgame and PvP</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  endgame at the beginning of this expansion is very similar to Legion's.  You will mainly be engaged in World Quests, completing the daily  'Emissary Quests', and dungeon runs to improve your gear for the  upcoming raid. Again you start with standard dungeons, then Heroic and  finally Mythics. The first Raid will be released in 2 weeks. So you  still have some time to prepare.</span></span><br /> <br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If PvP is more your thing then War Mode is the new feature for you. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can switch 'War Mode' on and off via your talents if you are Stormwind or Orgrimmar. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">What this does exactly is flag your character for PvP. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Open-World  PvP is now a thing and turning on War Mode not only allows you to fight  with players from the other faction, but also gives you a number of  benefits. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You will earn up to 10% more XP and your PvP talents will become available in the open world. </span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since  certain World Quests require you to travel to Kul Tiras as a Horde  player and to Zandalar as an Alliance player, War Mode is the new way to  get started with PvP in Battle For Azeroth.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h3><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">double custard</span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you're a fan of both, the new Island Expeditions might be a nice addition for you. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Island Expeditions, you travel to an island with two other players from your faction and must collect 6000 Azerite. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The enemy faction is on the other side of this same island with the same mission. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first faction to collect 6000 Azerite wins. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You  can collect Azerite by mining it, looting it from treasure chests or  simply by killing mobs ranging from trash to rare and elite. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can also encounter your opponent in certain expedition modes and battle each other to slow down their Azerite process.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Verdict</span></span></h2>           <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">World  of Warcraft: Battle For Azeroth feels like a fresh expansion with all  the good elements from Legion combined with new features in a beautiful  environment. The story is again very compelling and has some unexpected  twists here and there that will keep players in suspense for a while.  The new varieties that you qualify for are all super cool designed and  designed. The questing and leveling in the new areas is no longer a drag  as in previous expansions and this is a very big plus of Battle For  Azeroth. </span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Battle  For Azeroth has only just begun, but it already looks very promising.  We are looking forward to getting started with the raid in two weeks and  are very curious to see what further content this expansion will offer.  </span></span><div id="tap-translate"></div>
