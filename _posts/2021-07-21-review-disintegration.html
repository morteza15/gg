<div dir="ltr"><h4>Disintegration is a sci-fi fps with RTS elements that entails a good formula but ultimately falls short in practice. We were allowed to get started earlier, but now we have the full game.</h4>  <p>Disintegration was developed by V1 interactive. A small studio of about 30 people. The game was published by Private Division and released this month on PC, PS4 and Xbox One.</p>  <p>Players take on the role of Romer Shoal, a Gravcycle pilot. Romer can oversee the entire terrain from his position in the Gravcycle and can thus give commands to his squad. That is more or less the purpose of Disintegration. As a pilot of the Gravcycle, you can easily zoom around the terrain, shoot enemies yourself, but you also decide where your units go, which moves they will use and which points of interests they should study.</p>  <p>The multiplayer mode can support 10 players. Players can choose between 9 different crews, each with their own gameplay characteristics and abilities.</p>  <h2>Gameplay</h2>  <p>The game was of course discredited because one of the makers of Halo is behind the development. Disintegration is certainly an interesting mix of elements that create a promising formula but ultimately just not the immersive gameplay and depth we had hoped for.</p>  <p>The simple controls you have, immediately provide limited command options when you want to control your crew. You can point out enemies and issue attack commands. Besides that you can move the crew members and have objects studied. The controls and options are therefore also very scanty. There are no options to keep them waiting in defensive formations. Most battles, however, are well-balanced and let you control the team while you fly around and take out enemies yourself. <br>The controls and feel of the Gravcycle are great. Responsive dash moves and general controls that play well. Unfortunately, the massive vehicle&#39;s weapons feel a bit below par and you&#39;ll have to keep firing for a long time to defeat some enemies.</p>  <h5><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/D21186D6-B1C4-4DDC-A595-0A25641F32C7-1024x576.jpeg"></h5>  <h2>Story</h2>  <p>The story of Disintegration also lacks depth. Red-eyed robots fight the blue-eyed ones. That is the whole point of the story. The introduction of the campaign does not bring much to light. We learn that humanity has gone through a difficult period of war and disease. The solution turns out to be integration. In other words, the process in which a human conscience is uploaded into a robot body. We don&#39;t get to know much.</p>  <p>Romer also remains a mystery to us. He turns out to be a former famous Gravcycle pilot. A kind of faded glory. Romer has been a prisoner on the Iron Cloud. There he was interrogated by the obvious villain, Black Shuck.</p>  <p>After a major explosion, Romer unites with some rebels to take on Black Shuck and his team. Why they are going into this battle is not entirely clear.</p>  <p>Over time you will find new crew members. Both integrated and natural "non-integrated" people. The backstories of different clans are never really explained.</p>  <h2>looks</h2>  <p>The game looks beautiful. The levels are beautiful, clear and provide soothing gameplay. However, disintegration only comes into its own in the cutscenes. These are bizarrely polished with a high level of creativity. By the end of the 16 hour campaign you will be a little more interested in the story. However, the first few hours are slow and confusing.</p>  <h2> Issues</h2>  <p>Although Disintegration looks like a fantastic game, there are too many problems that prevent it from reaching its full potential. What should be simple is not simple in Disintegration. If you think all you need to do is send your crew into a healing circle to give them back their health, you&#39;re right. However, they will not stay in the healing area. They will go there, and immediately walk on to get killed by enemies again. This problem occurred more often in my time with the game and often makes you doubt the AI. In addition, between the many dialogues, cutscenes and side missions, the story remains difficult to follow. That said, Disintegration remains a very interesting game for players who are ready for something new. Hopefully this formula can be refined in the future.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/631CF6EC-20D2-4E89-9F19-C1BF85EADDF7-1024x576.jpeg"></p>  <p>The combat remains very simple and very slow throughout the game. The customization is limited and it rarely feels like the Gravcycle has enough firepower. You will do the most damage with the cooldown abilities of your crew. You will therefore use it as often as possible, whether it concerns a group of enemies or 1 large enemy. You will often use the same playstyle. Namely shooting at enemies from a great distance. Getting close only involves risk. When your crew goes down, pick them up by flying over them and they&#39;ll be back on the battlefield after a few seconds. That also ensures that the difficulty of the game (in normal mode) remains quite low. Missing variety in enemies also makes for a predictable fight. Only your own death has consequences,so keep your distance.</p>  <h2>Pros</h2>  <p>Some of the advantages of the game are in the multiplayer. Disintegration is considerably more fun with a bunch of friends. The multiplayer has three different modes. Retrieval, collector and zone control. These are fairly simple game modes that we often know from other shooters. While there are more loadouts in multiplayer, they don&#39;t add much to the action. The multiplayer often feels chaotic and it is never clear what the decisive factor for a win or loss has been.</p>  <h2>Conclusion</h2>  <p>It&#39;s hard to imagine who I would recommend Disintegration to. For RTS players, the game doesn&#39;t have enough commands and the depth is too low. For FPS players, however, the game feels too slow. Hopefully Disintegration can appeal to an audience that can relate to this innovative mix of gameplay elements.</p>  <div id="gmail-tap-translate"> </div></div>
