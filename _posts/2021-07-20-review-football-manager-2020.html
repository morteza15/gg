<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Everyone who watches football sometimes thinks: If I was a coach, I would have done it this way or that. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Well   you get that chance with Football Manager 2020. It doesn&#39;t pay as well   as in real life, but it can still be nice to be in control for once. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I myself once started with football manager games in the PlayStation 1 era. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Premier Manager 2000 I played all gray. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I even kept a record of everything players cost and how good they were on paper. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">20 years later it was time to dive back into the world of football manager.</font></font></h4>            <p><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">And a lot has changed in all those years. </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Football Manager 2020</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">   is a very comprehensive management game. Players of the series will   agree that you will never be bored in this game. There are quite a few   menus, each with their own sub menu where you can manage your team.   There are so many menus that it can even feel overwhelming if this is   your first time playing a football manager game. Well we&#39;ve played with   the management part of FIFA a bit, but this is different. Of course you   can immediately say that Football Manager was developed to manage and   FIFA was not, but FIFA manager did not disappoint. Nevertheless, you   notice that the Football Manager has worked out everything much better.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If we just look at the main menus, everything is covered. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Your team, mutual dynamics, tactics, reporting, staff, training and your medical center are represented. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Below you will find your agenda, league, transfer list, scouts, general club image, board of directors and your finances. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">And all these headings still have a dozen menus to walk through. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Fortunately, you can choose to leave a lot to your assistants. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This is definitely recommended if you&#39;re diving into the game for the first time. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">As you play the game and learn more, the further you can take matters into your own hands. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Football Manager 2020 is certainly newbie friendly in that regard.</font></font></p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Graphically not great</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Graphically,   Football Manager 2020 is not one of the most beautiful games to watch.   The menus look simplistic, not every player has a photo, your avatar can   only be customized in a few ways. If you attend a game of your team or   that of another, then you don&#39;t have to expect much spectacle. The   match graphics are particularly bad compared to FIFA. The players move   rather clumsily and the actions that happen on the field seem more like 2   toddlers playing an old FIFA game. For a game that has been around for a   while, I expected a little more from the quality of the game.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But   on the other hand, Football Manager 2020 is a game that mainly revolves   around you as a manager. So we want to condone the bad graphics. Still a   missed opportunity because something looks better than it is now.   Anyway, you spend 95 percent of the time in the game&#39;s many menus. And   that&#39;s a good thing actually. Because you get an incredible amount of   emails in your inbox. A week feels like an eternity when you go through   all the emails. Sometimes there were days when I wished you could just   drag everything to the spam folder at once.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">What is nice about Football Manager 2020 are the press conferences and the personal interviews. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Here you can build a working relationship with your fellow trainers and members of the press. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But here you can also develop animosity and rivalry. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can answer in various ways and also with what feeling you give the answer. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This in turn affects your players, trainers and press members. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Van Bommel put the pressure on me for the Johan Cruijf Scale. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But after a simple 6-0 victory I couldn&#39;t resist giving another kick to van Bommel. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This naturally resulted in a negative comeback from van Bommel and a rivalry was born.</font></font></p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict Football Manager 2020</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Football   Manager 2020 is an entertaining management game. The entire management   aspect is well and broadly deepened. The dynamics that you can have with   your team alone ensures sufficient playing fun. The dynamic you can   have with your fellow trainers and press members makes it even more fun   to be the manager of your club. Create your own story as a manager,   develop your own rivalries. Does the press love you? Or do you have   someone who is just like Hans Kraay Jr? Or worse Wilfred Genee. It&#39;s all   possible in this great management game. However, the game could have   been a bit better in terms of graphics. The matches look clumsy and   wooden. Pictures of players are missing, and you can only shape your own   avatar in a limited number of ways. In addition, you do not see your   avatar much in the game itself.With a little bit more effort, the game   could have looked fantastic. Nevertheless, we had a great time.</font></font></p></div>
