<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gravity Duck is a brand new indie title that you can add to your indie library for just €4.99. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The low price guarantees a short playthrough, but one that does not go without fast acting and a little brain-muscle training.</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   Gravity Duck, take on the role of a pixelated duck that actually says   very little &quot;quack&quot; to a duck. A little too little and we&#39;re worried.   Fortunately, the duck has special powers, namely the power to manipulate   gravity. This is the element that you will play with in the four theme   worlds in this game. With the push of a button you change gravity, but   only for you alone. You must use this to make your way to the golden egg   that is hidden on each level.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Along   the way you will see various obstacles such as nails covering   platforms, walls, floors and ceilings. Later you come across several   animals that don&#39;t want the best for Mr. Duck. The butterfly spits a   ball at it. As soon as this ball touches you you have to play the level   again. The caterpillar crawls back and forth, you may not touch it. The   bat flies after you. The trick is to block the bat by getting something   between the duck and the bat. The bat flies in a straight path behind   you and does not understand that a wall is blocking the way. Bats are   blind, so it is authentic.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A little later you will have to deal with zombies, fire traps and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You understand the principle. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Each level gets a little more difficult. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Depending on what your goal is, you don&#39;t have to complete the entire game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It is again a typical game, for the hunters.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Pling!</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If unlocking trophies is your favorite sound, this is the game for you. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s   not very difficult, you have reached the Platinum trophy within an hour   and the best of all is that you also get the game on the Playstation   Vita if you buy it on PS4. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The other way around, of course, also works. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game has a double trophy list. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This means you can play the game on both PS4 and Vita to earn twice as many trophies. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game is also available for Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You just can&#39;t get achievements or trophies on Nintendo Switch. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If you don&#39;t care about the trophies, you can even play the game for free on various websites via PC.</font></font></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If you&#39;re looking for your next &#39;EZ Plat&#39;, </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gravity Duck is</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> a game right up your alley. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If you&#39;re really desperate for the next 2D platformer then you might like this title too, maybe. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game is so short that I can hardly recommend it. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You fly through it in no time and it is very clear what this game is for. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The collectors. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It is therefore just what you are looking for. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It could be the next best thing for you, or you simply don&#39;t care about the trophies or achievements in a game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">On the other hand, €4.99. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Who does what to you? </font></font></p></div>
