<div dir="ltr"><h4>Recently a brand new Spider-Man title appeared on Playstation 4 and Playstation 5. If you are not quite up to date and missed the first game in 2018, the Ultimate Edition of Miles Morales offers the ultimate solution.</h4>  <p>Spider-Man Remastered is included as an extra game in the Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition for Playstation 5. This version is not available for Playstation 4. Just like the differences between the Playstation 4 and Playstation 5 version of Miles Morales , see we made similar improvements in the remaster.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marvels-Spider-Man-Remastered_20201126125307-scaled.jpg"></p>  <h2>The full package</h2>  <p>With the Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition you are completely up-to-date with Spider-Man on Playstation in one go. In addition to the brand new Miles Morales game, the game also contains the original game from 2018 including all DLC that came out after that. The entire game is equipped with a Playstation 5 upgrade so that you can also choose from Performance Mode and Fidelity Mode in the remaster.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marvels-Spider-Man-Remastered_20201126132239-scaled.jpg"></p>  <p>Just like we discussed in the Miles Morales review, you have Raytracing in Fidelity mode and 60 FPS in Performance mode. The differences are big, but again both versions play very well and they are both fully in their right.</p>  <p>There is good news for returning Spider-Man fans in the remaster. You can use your old Playstation 4 savegameuse in the Playstation 5 remaster. Because of this you have to update your save file to the latest version by starting the game, saving it, and uploading it. You do all this via the main menu of the 2018 game. This does mean that, if you have or had a physical version, you still need it to access the save file. You don&#39;t need a Playstation 4 system. if your savegame is in the Playstation Plus cloud you can also use it and use the backwards compatible version to upload your savefile to Spider-Man Remastered. Once successful, all your achieved trophies will also be transferred. Did you get the Platinum on Playstation 4? Free Platinum in the Playstation 5 remaster!</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marvels-Spider-Man-Remastered_20201125032440-scaled.jpg"></p>  <h2>Makeover Pete</h2>  <p>You probably won&#39;t have missed it on the internet. Peter Parker looks a little different in the Spider-Man remaster than we are used to. It has become a completely different person. Other characters have been given a more subtle approach that makes them look more detailed than in the 2018 game. Everything looks better that way. There are a lot more people on the street, just like in Miles Morales on Playstation 5. Suits are of high quality and by zooming in you can even see which threads everything is woven from. There is a lot of attention to detail in this remaster, very similar to Spider-Man: Miles Morales.<img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marvels-Spider-Man-Remastered-Official-4K-PS5-Trailer-0-6-screenshot.png"></p>  <p>In fact, there is so much attention to detail that the infamous square-headed boat NPC now carries an extra easter egg with it. If you know who I&#39;m talking about, go check it out!</p>  <h2>Even more improvements</h2>  <p>Of course it not only looks better on Playstation 5, but it also plays a lot nicer. On the one hand by the option to play in 60 FPS, but there is more. Due to the power of the SSD, loading times have all but disappeared in Spider-Man Remastered. The game starts up in a few seconds. Fast travel in the game takes 1 to 2 seconds.</p>  <p>Furthermore, the game uses the same features as Miles Morales on Playstation 5. 3D audio where you hear all the cars driving past you as you swing low over the ground and a subtle application of haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marvels-Spider-Man-Remastered_20201126130953-scaled.jpg"></p>  <h2>Plays nice</h2>  <p>If you&#39;ve played the original game, you may be familiar with the therapeutic lurking around New York. The gameplay is still as great as it was two years ago and is unchanged. Be sure to read our original reviewwhere we go into the content of the game. Even if you were not familiar with the original, but have played Spider-Man: Miles Morales, you will notice that the games play about the same. Swing, combat, the mission structure and the way open-world content is woven into the story. The games are very similar but differ enough in certain respects to distinguish them. For example, Peter Parker has different gadgets and special attacks compared to Miles. Personally, I like Miles&#39;s better and Miles Morales seems like a logical evolution as part 2 in a growing franchise.</p>  <p>So it&#39;s great to see how Miles Morales continues to build on the rock-solid foundation that was set in 2018.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marvels-Spider-Man-Remastered_20201126131005-scaled.jpg"></p>  <h2>Verdict</h2>  <p>Spider-Man Remastered has been processed with as much love as Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Lots of details and graphical improvements in the remaster. The ability to use your Playstation 4 savegame on Playstation 5 is a huge win for all returning fans in this remaster to complete the previously released DLC stories for example. With all Playstation 5 improvements, this remaster is definitely worth the 20 euros extra for the Spider-Man Miles Morales Ultimate Edition. At least if you haven&#39;t played the 2018 game (completely) yet. If you&#39;ve already completed it completely, including DLC, there&#39;s nothing new to see outside of a nice and improved picture.</p>  <div id="gmail-tap-translate">Â </div></div>
