While playing through these worlds, you as a character become more powerful, but Trover also becomes more powerful. Your chair, where you sit throughout the game, becomes more powerful as other characters in the game spit on you. This can make your chair float, for example, so that you can view the world from a higher point. Trover grows stronger as a power baby in its eye socket eats another power baby. Yes really. This will allow Trover to unlock new abilities such as reels and double jumps.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">All upgrades happen at logical moments in the game, so you can enjoy the strange environments and the especially funzige and oblique conversations that take place here and there without thinking too much about the game. The puzzles and gameplay in general remains quite simple, but this is not a bad thing as this is the essence of the game. Stupid puzzles are bad game design according to Trover. During the first level you have to solve a puzzle by pressing a number of buttons. Trover soon runs out of patience and asks you to simply smash the gate instead of solving the puzzle. "Shall we check online? Maybe there is a guide or something?" and "What were the developers thinking with all these buttons. Buttons aren&#39;t fun, it&#39;s lazy!" are things Trover is saying to you right now.</font></font></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Not for the kids</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Trover saves the Universe is clearly not a game aimed at a young audience. The game is full of swear words and generally rather rude comments. For example, at some point you will have to make a choice to kill someone. You have the choice of two people. One person is a big busybody and has been nagging at you for a good five minutes, the other speeds up the pregnancy process in women so that he can eat the fetuses. I&#39;m really not making this up! Every conversation in this game is really hilarious, but luckily you can also participate in the conversation. You just don&#39;t have a voice, so you have to do it by nodding yes or no. Because of this, you can sometimes choose to lie, or to speak the truth. The outcome is not different depending on your choice, but it does make for a hilarious conversation between the characters.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><br></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Almost forgot, your dogs!</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The story, of course, is about rescuing your two doggies and stopping Glorkon. All of the above choices and conversations all take place during gameplay at enough different times. You go after Glorkon by collecting materials in different worlds to stop him. Each world has different strange characters, conversations, challenges and small puzzles. As said before, it remains quite simple. The biggest challenge is finding all the power babies in the worlds you travel. Finding power babies will give you more life points and a super special reward at the end of the game if you have found all the power babies. Ultimately, the story isn&#39;t that impressive, but it&#39;s more the way everything is told,how the characters interact and how the game is made fun of that the beauty of Trevor saves the Universe.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><br></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Trevor Saves the Universe might be the funniest game I&#39;ve played this year. The humor, the characters, the general strange conversations and everything on it make for an unforgettable VR experience. The gameplay and story aren&#39;t impressive at all, but they&#39;re still very enjoyable, purely because of the way everything fits together in this stupid universe. Defeating enemies remains genius because of the stupid cries they give out and the magnanimity of them and you are always curious what the next absurd thing is that you will encounter on your path. It is simply impossible to express how genius this game is, so you really just have to experience it for yourself. For example, the two Glorkon clones in the screenshot above keep talking all the time, they don&#39;t stop!First they laugh at you and they start challenging you, then one asks the other how his appointment with the doctor went. It really doesn&#39;t matter at all and it&#39;s really genius. Trevor Saves the Universe is a must-have if you&#39;re a fan of oblique gross humor and can appreciate a WTF moment about every five minutes.</font></font></p></div>
