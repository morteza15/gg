<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Everyone   is familiar with the success of Gears Of War 1 through 3. Gears 4   unfortunately brought a lot of mixed reactions, how does this new title,   Gears 5, fare? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Read all about it in our review!</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gears</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> 5 is a game with many features, modes and progression. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Now of course the question is whether this game will come out better than the fourth? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Small Spoiler: Yes! </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gears 5 has a great campaign and there is a lot to do in this game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Not everything is perfect or good at all, of course, but we&#39;ll talk about that in a moment! </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gears   is of course one of the most famous Xbox Exclusive games and was   previously also known as one of the best Xbox franchises. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Can Gears 5 make a full recovery after the mixed reactions of its predecessor?</font></font></p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/h35_KOgslkM/maxresdefault.webp" width="546" height="307"><br><br>            <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">campaign</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   first 14 hours I spent in Gears 5 obviously went into the storyline.   The story of Gears of War is fantastic in every part. Even though Gears 4 had a   strong story despite everything, Gears 5 is no exception! The campaign   is much more open than before and there are more RPG elements in it than   ever before. What&#39;s also fantastic is that now that you know that Kait   has a Locust background, playing her character has more weight. The   alternation between different types of areas is fantastically done in   this part. The areas feel less linear. You can explore open areas by   means of a &#39;Skiff&#39;. Whoever made this design certainly had a good time!   The intermediate areas are fun to blast through with your Skiff, but   don&#39;t immediately give you the feeling of exploration. This is because</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   Gears 5 campaign gave me those old vibes again. With characters like   Marcus that is of course a bit nostalgic, but JD, Del and Kait also felt   a little more deeply tied into the story this time than in the previous   game. JD has a slightly smaller role this time, even Marcus is slightly   more in the picture. There is also slightly less testosterone level,   since Kait shows just a little more emotion in this game than you have   ever experienced in a Gears game! Gears 5 has a big raw factor and you   notice especially in the beginning of the story how beat-up characters   are with what they all had to go through in finding a world full of   peace and especially without Locust. The combat of Gears 5 is also great   fun, actually not much changes,but what has changed is nice and subtle   and this makes everything a lot more fun to blow through. Something that   was seen in many videos and what I immediately noticed is that the   combat is a little less in-your-face and feels a little less punchy.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Jack is a much loved addition to the game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Jack is a kind of robot drone that can deliver strong attacks to your character. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This friendly robot allows you to make attacks that were previously impossible. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The same goes for utility and Jack can make you invisible for a short period of time. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can upgrade this skill so that you can eventually remain invisible for longer and keep shooting yourself. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Jack can even make enemies sort of get hacked and have to fight for you. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">So you see that a unique addition can also turn out well and Jack is more than welcome in Gears 5! </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Oh, yes, he can also pick up stuff for you that you can&#39;t reach yourself. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Can&#39;t I get one in real life that takes my beer out of the fridge?</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">What a picture</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gears   5 can be played on the Xbox One (X) and on your Windows computer. The   game looks really great on both and makes full use of the graphics power   of the Xbox One X. On PC the game runs great for me in any case. The   game never went below 100 frames per second, and that with a GTX 1070.   What I did notice is that the game drained almost all of my CPU&#39;s power,   leaving Discord stuck and no one in the call understood anything. from   what I said. Other than that, the game ran smoothly and looked   fan-tas-tic!</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In terms of sound design, the game has slightly less impact this time than the first three parts. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The voice acting, on the other hand, is once again top notch and well executed. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">What was striking and also quite disturbing, is that the sound was sometimes simply not heard, while there were subtitles. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This only happened a few times and it was mostly when saving the game.</font></font></p>                        <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">multiplayer</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Although the campaign was the whole reason for me to pick up the game, I quite enjoyed the other modes that the game includes. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">One of these being the multiplayer. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The multiplayer in Gears titles has always been unique from your standard shooters. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Yes, maybe a little unbalanced, but still a cool experience.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   have competitive multiplayer, which offers a fairly monotonous but   fun experience. This time it is even true that Jack plays some kind of   role in the multiplayer experience. It can also get nice and chaotic at   times and it&#39;s still cool when you blast an enemy apart with your   shotgun or just knock his head off with a finishing move. The versus   experience is and remains a cool experience. The maps are also nice and   vertical and have multiple height levels. All seven current maps are   wonderfully put together and also vary in size. The maps are dynamic and   can create an ice storm that opens new paths and closes old ones. I&#39;ve   had quite a few hours of fun in these modes!</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Horde has gotten more strategic elements, especially with the added class cards. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">With these cards you can make your character your own. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can also hand out roles to each other to add a new layer of strategy. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Find out for yourself what works for your team and try it out. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">So a great experience!</font></font><br> <br></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gears 5 is a fantastic game and continues to stand out from the competition as a franchise. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   nostalgia is present, the gameplay plays well, there is more than   enough content and the game also looks breathtakingly good. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">On some minor bugs and the slightly less depth in terms of progression, the game is highly recommended. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I personally would get an Xbox just to play Gears 5 and Forza Horizon 4. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In my opinion, this is a must if you are a fan of the series, your Xbox or a nice and unique shooter!</font></font></p></div>
