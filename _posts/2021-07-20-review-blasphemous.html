<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A game that stayed with us very much after our Gamescom visit was Blasphemous. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The pixel art Metroidvania Dark Souls game is set in a dark Spanish Inquisition. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Not entirely without swearing, I had a good time with this title during two 12-hour flights.</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">My adventure to make Tokyo unsafe started with an 11 hour delay, but this was not the biggest obstacle in my journey. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The enemies and boss fights in Blasphemous on the other hand. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This game is tricky, fun, addictive, but also quite tricky. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Or did I already say that? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Despite the fact that the game is quite spicy, you will be punished less if you die than with Dark Souls, for example. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In that respect you can compare the combat and dying system a bit better with Nioh.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Die, try again, die</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Dying   is something that won&#39;t be very rare in Blasphemous. First, you will   have to deal with many varied enemies that differ greatly from each   other on all fronts. On the one hand nice for a change, on the other hand   very challenging. Especially when several appear in your path at once.   Enemies have different attacks, with different ranges, and some also   have shields that prevent you from hitting them from a certain point.   You get points for beating enemies. You can then exchange these for   upgrades or items that make your ride through the game more bearable.   For example, you have the choice to repeat a certain wave of enemies by   kneeling at a shrine. This will replenish your life points, but all   defeated (normal) enemies will return to life.This is a handy feature if   you are having trouble progressing. Just grind, make yourself stronger   and try that boss again.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Nioh used this same concept, but there was a little snag that made it a bit more difficult. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In Blasphemous, after you die, you will surrender some of your Mana bar. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">By visiting your place of death you will get your missing part back. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There are also places where you can get cleansed for points. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If   you die again before you have been able to visit your death spot you   will again lose part of your mana bar, but you can still claim both of   them back.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Brutal pixels!</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Blasphemous   uses great pixel art and gameplay as well as cutscenes and if you ask   me it&#39;s probably one of the best I&#39;ve ever seen. On several occasions I   looked out with wide open eyes and &quot;wow!&quot; mumbled. I totally did not   expect that with a pixel art you could process such a degree of detail   and brutality in a title. The setting and style fit together so well and   some of the executions look really brutal.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Of course this is not entirely due to the pixel art style but more to the art direction that has been chosen in this game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Everything   seems to be very carefully selected and even the things that initially   seem a bit strange to you, such as that thing on your head, will carry   much more meaning later on. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">During   the game you will encounter varied areas such as mountain peaks, barren   ruins, underground sections and each and every one of these areas looks   very beautiful and varied.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Search and you will find</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">As I have already mentioned, this is a &#39;Metroidvania&#39; in its best form. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You play through a non-linear area where you can explore right, left, top, bottom and everything in between. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It is not very clear which way to go, but you will get directions about what you are looking for. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">So at certain moments you get the feeling that you think you are in the right place. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">After all, it corresponds to the description you received earlier. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Are you snooping completely on the wrong side? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That&#39;s no problem at all, because discovering new places is pretty well rewarded. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You don&#39;t really want to go straight for your goal, but first take a good look around. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Who knows, you might find some useful items that will help you, or maybe something else..</font></font><br> <br></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Blasphemous is a fast-paced, yet own-paced action platformer that will stay with you for a long time. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   choice of drawing style combined with the dark setting of the game   works very well and is finely edited to offer you the best experience   possible. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A must have for all Metroidvania or Souls-like enthusiasts. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If you don&#39;t like both genres, it might be an interesting title to try out. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game is quite forgiving to new players due to the &#39;grind principle&#39;. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can learn patterns that will help you achieve success with practice. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In any case, </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The Game Kitchen</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> has had great success with Blasphemous.</font></font></p></div>
