<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Frontier Developments already owes its fame to the successful game Planet Coaster. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In Planet Coaster you can build your own amusement park. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It is not surprising that a zoo version would also be released after a while. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Planet Zoo is the latest game from Frontier Developments. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Here you can create your own zoo in peace. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Well, in peace, just like in Planet Coaster there are a number of things that demand your attention.</font></font></h4>            <p><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s   been a long time since I played a fun builder game. Planet Zoo has   brought me back to the builder games. Because once the game runs well   it&#39;s a great zoo builder. The game consists of a number of different   modes. You have the Campaign in which you learn to play the game on the   basis of missions. In Franchise mode you can create your own zoo under   varying circumstances. And then you have the Sandbox mode in which you   can build to your heart&#39;s content without having to worry about   finances.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Franchise mode is the mode that most people will play in Planet Zoo. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In the options you can choose an online or an offline animal park. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Offline you have a computer generated pet trade in which you can purchase your animals. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Online you are more at the mercy of the animals that other players put up for sale. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">These are sold and bought in a currency other than your default money. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Especially in the beginning of your zoo it is often lucky at the pet trade if you want the rarer animals. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This does cause some frustration, especially if you start a new zoo and therefore always have to start with the small animals.</font></font></p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Build and care</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Like   any builder game, you spend quite a bit of time building your zoo. If   you haven&#39;t played Frontier Developments before, building your zoo will   take some getting used to. Planet Zoo is quite extensive in what you can   do and build. You can build and combine practically anything in the   game. And with this you get the most fantastic designs. On various   forums you can view all the creations of people who also play the game.   Nothing is too crazy and you can let your creative mind loose on it. You   can also build your zoo in different themes that match the animals.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   addition to building, you spend the rest of your time looking after the   animals in Planet Zoo. Each animal has its own preference in terms of   living environment. For example, you can change the surface on which the   animals live or add vegetation to the enclosure. But the animals can   also get bored in your enclosure, this is solved by providing the   enclosure with toys or other objects. You also have to take the   composition of your animals into account. You can also pay attention to   gender, but also to other animal species.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The unfortunate thing about Planet Zoo is that in the base game they mainly chose land animals to start with. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You have little choice of animals that live in the water. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">And the animals that you can choose are mainly the tropical ones. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Hopefully   they will soon come with a DLC where you can also buy some more aquatic   animals, such as penguins, orcas, dolphins and otters. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Also, it would be nice to get birds in your zoo.</font></font><br> <br></p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict Planet Zoo</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Planet Zoo is a good and fun zoo builder. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can make your own zoo very extensively. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You have enough freedom and choices to set it up according to your own taste. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In addition, you also spend enough time taking care of your animals and you are not just building. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Franchise mode is the most fun mode to play. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Playing Franchise online is a bit tedious since you don&#39;t have to buy most animals with money but with another currency. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">And you can only gain that currency by buying animals yourself or putting them out in nature. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It is also a pity that mainly terrestrial animals have been chosen. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I would have preferred to see some more aquatic animals, hopefully a DLC is coming soon. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But despite this, Planet Zoo is a really fun game to play.</font></font></p></div>
