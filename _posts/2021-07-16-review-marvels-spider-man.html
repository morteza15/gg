<p></p><h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Spider-Man  will be released on September 7 exclusively for the Playstation 4. It  has been quiet for years about the Spider-Man titles on the console. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Can Insomniac breathe new life into it on the Playstation? </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">And do they know how to keep the pools of water in perfect condition? </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Read on quick!</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In  Marvel's Spider-Man you take on the role of an adult Peter Parker who  is already very used to his powers. Parker is no longer a student, but  has just started his professional career with his teacher Otto Octavius.  Parker is a genius in the lab and Otto is reaping the benefits. Not  only in the lab do you benefit from these skills, but also in your  double life as Spider-Man you will have to use these skills more often.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Marvel's Spider-Man is a completely new story. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is not a reboot, remaster or game version of a movie, but a uniquely original story. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps new is not the right word, but rather alternative. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">As most players have already seen in the trailer, there are well-known villains returning in this Spider-Man game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Electro, Scorpio and Rhino, just to name a few. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Spider-Man  is familiar with these villains, but you'll encounter them again in  this game as they're part of a new plan that puts the security of New  York at risk.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">New York from above</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">A  big part of the game consists of Spider-Man swinging around the city of  New York. As mentioned in the preview of the game, the swinging in this  game is truly phenomenal. There are seriously too few words to describe  how enjoyable it is to meander through New York City as Spider-Man.  It's almost therapeutic. It all goes very smoothly and completely as you  have it in your mind. You really are as free as a bird in New York and  the way in which you can move cannot be counted on 10 fingers. Swing,  jump, dive, parkour, you name it. In addition, all these moves can be  combined in fractions of seconds, which ensures that just wandering  through the city already provides a pleasant gameplay experience.</span></span><br /> <br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span class="" style="vertical-align: inherit;">There  have also been times when the city screamed for help, but Spider-Man  took on a challenge with himself to swing around the city as quickly as  possible. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is not a challenge in the game, but a challenge from the heart. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fast travel will eventually be possible in-game, but you'll likely only use this feature five times to unlock the trophy. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why else would you use fast travel? </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's a SPIDER-MAN game! </span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Look what a beautiful view.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Combat also extremely fluid</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not only the movement through the city, but also the combat in Insomniac's Spidey adventure is really fantastic. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Occasionally certain combinations of enemies can make your life miserable, but luckily there is an answer for everything.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just  as you have a lot of freedom with transport, the same also applies to  combat. You decide how you will handle a certain encounter. Will you  very quietly cocoon everyone from lampposts, or will you jump directly  between the villains to let them taste your danoontje power? The choice  is yours. Really. You can use various gadgets such as the web shooter,  but also a number of others. All gadgets have a situation where they  come in handy and some are just fun, not necessarily useful. Make your  enemies float for a few seconds, for example. Not really necessary, but  it does look funny.</span></span><br /> <br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">To top it off, there are special moves that you can perform once a meter fills up by performing combat moves. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This special move can be very varied and you can choose it yourself. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, there is a catch here. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The special moves are unlocked by unlocking new suits for Peter Parker. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Almost every suit comes with a special power and once you unlock a suit you can activate this power on all unlocked suits. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">So you are not forced to wear a certain suit because that power is installed on it, but you must first unlock the relevant suit.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Which spider logo is fashionable?</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">To  embroider a little further on these different suits.. There are a lot  of different outfits that you can unlock and wear in this game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some have already become known, such as the new suit with the white logo. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the traditional Spider-Man suit and the one from The Avengers are also available. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, there are a number of suits that most will recognize, but also some creative new looks for Peter Parker.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The friendly neighbor</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of  course it's not just your job to save New York from evil, but the  house-garden-kitchen incidents are still part of Spider-Man's life. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tackle petty criminal activities, help citizens with various side quests. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Completing  different types of challenges in the city and searching for  collectibles provide plenty of content in this virtual version of New  York. </span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many  collectibles will be familiar to die-hard fans, but there are also  plenty of nods here and there to other Marvel stories and even an  obvious nod to DC's Batman.</span></span></p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">A sticky story</span></span></h2>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  story in Spider-Man as described in the beginning is kind of new, but  not quite. There are of course many new elements in the story, but also  familiar, and predictable moments. Especially the first few hours in the  story feel very slow. It's only after you get past halfway through the  story that things get really interesting. Strange turns will take place  and there are a lot of exciting moments that will have you on the edge  of your seat. At this point you definitely want to play through the  story unlike the first few hours in the game where you definitely don't  feel that rushed. The memorable moments are therefore all spread out in  the second part, as I'll call it, of the game. Which makes the first  half a bit insignificant, which is a shame.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was concerned about the story for the first few hours. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fortunately it worked out very well in the end and the tension was present until the last minute.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Verdict</span></span></h2>           <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Marvel's Spider-Man is a great Playstation 4 game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">New York looks stunning with its Marvel features. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Visually it's not the most beautiful Playstation exclusive we've seen, but also far from the ugliest. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It just looks damn good. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  game is very fluid in both combat and traversal and the story as said  has a nice ending but it starts a bit difficult before it managed to  conquer me as a player. </span><span class="" style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  world is packed with action, missions and challenges to keep you busy  and if you try hard enough, you just might unlock this trophy someday.</span></span><div id="tap-translate"></div>
