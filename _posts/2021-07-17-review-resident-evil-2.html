The big difference between a remaster and a remake is that in a remake not only the graphic side is given a polish. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The entire game has been developed from scratch. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Of course it differs from its original in many ways and that&#39;s a good thing. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">If both games were exactly the same, there is little value in playing the 2019 version multiple times. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Several times? </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Yes, several times!</font></font></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The best Resident Evil ever</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">After playing Resident Evil 7 I already mentioned that this part sets </font></font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">the bar very high</font></font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"> for the horror genre. It was one of my favorite horror titles, but Capcom even surpasses this masterpiece. I don&#39;t want to beat around the bush, to be honest. Resident Evil 2 is a masterpiece. Sometimes it&#39;s the small details that do it and this is certainly a case of this game. While playing, but also after playing you notice that Resident Evil 2 has been a project with a lot of passion. The gameplay, the characters and even the unlockable bonus content in the game radiate this.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">For example, by achieving different challenges in the game that are not always visible, you can unlock different outfits or models. You can use the outfits for your next playthroughs. You can view the models in the main menu. While playing, you may not always have the same amount of time to admire Ada&#39;s beauties. By unlocking these models you can view them later in the main menu.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">In addition, it has a replay value of extremely high value. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">And that for a single player game! </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">My first playthrough with Leon lasted no less than 9 hours and 45 minutes, but that&#39;s not enough. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">You can then start a new story with Claire to see the story from a completely different perspective. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Of course, many elements remain the same, but there are a lot of things that you completely skip in your first playthrough. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The game is meant to be played multiple times. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Best of all, it doesn&#39;t get boring.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The way Capcom handles this is very special, you might walk through the same rooms, but the order of activities and locations of stuff have been slightly adjusted. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">As a result, you will work completely differently in the next playthrough, even in the familiar places.</font></font></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Complete the picture</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Blood, gore, shattering zombies, body parts and lots of meat that will surprise even a butcher is what this game has to offer. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">While it all looks very brutal. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">I mean this both figuratively and literally. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Graphically, Resident Evil 2 is one of the most beautiful, if not the most beautiful horror games on the market and is a real joy to watch. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Everything looks very realistic and the way lighting works in this game is really beautiful. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">As you would expect, it is quite dark and almost nowhere are the lights on. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Very occasionally you can turn on a light somewhere and this usually means that you are in a safe space where you can store. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The rest of the time you have to make do with your flashlight.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The great thing about this is that you actually use your flashlight to scan the room for hazards and stuff. Often it is so dark that you cannot see if the floor is clear of roaming zombies. The way you illuminate the room with your flashlight is incredibly realistic and believable. It does seem like a lamp is being shined on your character, which is actually not the case. On the other hand, this makes sense since you couldn&#39;t see yourself if you weren&#39;t. To give you an idea, take a look at how Claire&#39;s flashlight illuminates this space.</font></font></p><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">If the visual aspect isn&#39;t enough, luckily we have some sounds to enhance the atmosphere. Once again, Capcom knows to hit the nail on the head here. You know that feeling when you want to play with a headset, but then you don&#39;t? If you don&#39;t know that feeling yet, give it a try in Resident Evil 2. Then you know the feeling. The sounds in this game are so well made that you simply have to listen carefully at times to hear if the coast is clear. Is mr. X nearby? You can hear the thumping footsteps coming from a distance and the closer they come to you, the louder you will hear them. You can even determine where he is by listening carefully. Two rooms awayor is he upstairs? Did he just open a door? In addition, the sounds of the environment are lifelike, such as the rain pattering against the windows outside.</font></font><br></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)">Gamedesign en vijanden</h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">So is there anything negative to say about Capcom&#39;s REtake on Resident Evil 2? Almost not, but maybe a little. What&#39;s honestly more frustrating than tricky are several boss fights in this game. There are plenty and they are all very interesting with cool tactics that are not too difficult to implement. The big problem with boss fights is the available space. Your character is not exactly an athlete and they have never heard of diving. If you don&#39;t keep enough distance you will undoubtedly be hit when a boss charges at you. A simple dodge could have prevented this whole problem. It wouldn&#39;t even have been a problem if the rooms were a bit more spacious. Almost all boss fights take place in narrow spaces. Understandable too.It gives you a tight feeling of having to react quickly before you get screwed, but the ability to duck for a while or jump to the sidelines pretty much goes along the lines of quick-response. It often feels like you&#39;re still being hit even though you were sure you swerved in time.</font></font><br style="box-sizing:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">On the other hand, zombies are incredibly fat and believable in this game. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">She will knock down about three shots in the face, although this is sometimes only temporarily. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">If you don&#39;t fatally blow the face into 100 pieces against the wall, there is a significant chance that the zombie in question will simply rise again or will have disappeared when you walk past it again at a later time. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Shotguns are especially effective at literally knocking down a zombie and it feels really good to see this happen. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Often zombies even take local damage. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Once you hit them with your gun you can see where the bullet hit it. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Incredibly brutal! </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Unfortunately, this doesn&#39;t seem to be consistent. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn&#39;t.</font></font><br></p><h3 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:1.75rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">This is how you apply backtracking</font></font></h3><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Backtracking, everyone has an opinion about it and usually this opinion is not very positive. Why? Backtracking is usually a really lazy way to extend a game and force you to go back to places you&#39;ve already visited. This also applies to Resident Evil 2, but on a completely different level. Backtracking is a big element of this game, but in a good way. You are working on it throughout the game and you get a little further and you can search more rooms as you find more stuff to help you in your quest. Certain rooms are shielded in different ways until you come across a key, pliers, code or other special item to unlock the room. Finding such an item and remembering what it was for and then going after it arouses a certain amount of curiosity.What&#39;s in that room? Which room can I open next? What will I need to unlock this space? This thought goes through your head throughout the game and this way of backtracking in a game is very well done.</font></font><br></p><h2 style="box-sizing:inherit;clear:both;font-family:&quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.2;font-size:2rem;color:rgb(64,64,64)"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2><p style="box-sizing:inherit;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(64,64,64);font-family:&quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,Graphik,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit"><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Resident Evil 2 is a horror game that looks horrifying. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s a masterpiece both in sound and graphics and in terms of gameplay there are very few things that could have been better. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">The game plays very well and playing through multiple stories is greatly stimulated. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">For the full experience is therefore necessary to do. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Fortunately, playing through the game multiple times never gets boring as your new playthroughs will vary. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">In addition, the game offers many challenges that you can throw yourself into to get the most out of it. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Resident Evil 2 raises the bar once again for the future in this genre. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Another worthy Resident Evil that eliminates all nonsense and focuses on what it&#39;s all about. </font><font style="box-sizing:inherit;vertical-align:inherit">Gruesome horror.</font></font></p></div>
