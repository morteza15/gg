<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The Nintendo Switch always excels for me in the party games. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Mario Party and Mario Kart are two of the most fun games to play with friends or family. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Mario   &amp; Sonic is also at the Olympic Games: Tokyo 2020. In the run-up to   next year&#39;s Olympic Games, Nintendo will come up with a new game that   revolves around the Olympic Games and Mario, Sonic and co. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Is this game one that we can happily add to the list of party games? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can read the answer to that in our review.</font></font></h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Mario   &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games: Tokyo 2020 is not just a party game   with a sports theme. There is a real story mode incorporated in the   game. Besides the boyfriends and girlfriends of Mario and Sonic, the   arch-rivals of the two are also in the game. Bowser and Dr. Eggman also   have a nefarious plan in this game to ruin the lives of the two heroes.   dr. Eggman has developed a game console on which the 1964 Tokyo Olympics   can be played. But as soon as the power button is pressed, our heroes   are sucked into the game console, along with Toad, Bowser and Dr.   Eggman.</font></font><br><p> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Once   in the game console everything is back in the 8 bit style and this   provides a nice flashback for the older gamers among us. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Mario   and Sonic now have to do their very best during the Tokyo Olympics in   1964. Because if they have won enough gold medals, they can find an exit   to get out of the game console. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Of course, Bowser and Dr. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Eggman will do everything he can to win the gold medals himself. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Nice   about the story mode of Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games: Tokyo   2020, there are several Toads or boards in the game that teach you   everything about the Olympic Games being held in Tokyo. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">So if you approach a Toad you can learn something.</font></font></p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Mini Games enough</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Of   course you can play any sport that is in the game separately from the   story. You can do this alone or with your friends. You can play the mini   games with up to four people. And there is still plenty of choice. Of   course not all sports are represented in the game, but the diversity is   excellent. Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games: Tokyo 2020 has three   different types of mini games. You have the 2020 style sports and the   1964 retro style and to top it off you have three more dream sports.   Those dream sports are actually oversized versions of a number of other   mini games.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The 2020 mini games are 21 in total. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Add   to that the three dream sports and the ten retro games and you have a   collection of 34 mini games to play with your friends. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Each mini game is fun and well thought out. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   controls are sometimes a bit tricky, but I think that&#39;s more because I   don&#39;t know the button layout of the Nintendo Switch that well myself. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gymnastics is not a mini game for me where you have to make various button combos.</font></font></p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games: Tokyo 2020 </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">is   a fun party game that can stand between Mario Kart and Mario Party. You   have plenty of mini games to play that all differ in difficulty. But   they never get too difficult. The fact that you can switch between the   contemporary graphics and the retro graphics makes the game super   recognizable for older players. The story mode is a nice set up story   that plays nicely if you want to play alone for a while. However, as   soon as you finish the story, the game is a lot less fun for the solo   gamer. That&#39;s why we only recommend getting this game if you always have   friends or family around. Nintendo has also added a nice touch to the   game by putting some fun facts and tidbits in the game. With this you   can learn about the Olympic Games in Tokyo next year as well as 1964.</font></font><br> <br></p></div>
