<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Yooka and Laylee are back with a vengeance! </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   tribute duo to Banjoo and Kazooie find themselves this time in a world   that is less 3D than the previous one, but manages to bring out the more   originality of Playtonic. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Not being faithful to, but more of a &#39;that&#39;s how it is!&#39; </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">principle. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">And frankly, that turns out to be very colorful for Yooka-Laylee.</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Where   the original functioned as a big nod to the Banjoo platformers, Yooka   and Laylee failed to convince the majority of the crowd with their happy   faces and a colorful world. The platforming and collecting as usual was   there, but the nostalgia, which is missing. Nostalgia is not   immediately an ingredient for the perfect recipe, but it does its   wonders. Looking at the Spyro and Crash trilogy, we can certainly   confirm this. The games are all very old, dated, but the fresh look and   the memories from then complete the picture. This wasn&#39;t quite true for   Yooka and Laylee, but with the Impossible Lair they know how to sweeten   up the slightly sour taste completely.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Goodbye 3D platformer and hello 2D glory. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A little further back in time, but not with nostalgic thoughts. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A   completely fresh look at 2D platforming ensures that this provides a   constant challenge from Yooka-Laylee and that is because you can decide   when you want to finish the game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You just have to get it done, of course.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The Impossible Lair</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Yooka-Laylee   and the Impossible Lair works on a very simple principle. As soon as   you start the game and have gone through the short introduction you will   immediately be confronted with the final boss. Obviously you won&#39;t be   able to beat this one and you will lose. No worries. It&#39;s all part of   it, this isn&#39;t necessarily the Dark Souls of the colorful 2D   platformers, although it can be. If you want this of course. You lose   the fight and end up in an overworld that you approach from an overhead   perspective. Still a little bit 3D.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   will then be instructed to pass through the Impossible Lair to defeat   the enemy. But that mission is quite &#39;impossible&#39;. Never mind, it gets   easier. By collecting bees you will always be able to survive one   against the other. By collecting more bees you can end up being able to   withstand more knocks in the Impossible Lair. This makes it more and   more possible. You could complete the game in one go by playing the   Impossible Lair directly. However, this is extremely difficult without   extra lives. You are practically not allowed to get hit and this level   fires at you literally anything it can fire at you. Tricky platform   sections. Many enemies and so on. You also have no idea what all these   dangers are and how to react to them when you see them for the first   time.By playing through the rest of the game, you will become familiar   with the various enemies and traps that appear in your path.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You will be able to play through the levels through the game by constantly buying new areas through a literal &#39;paywall&#39;. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   don&#39;t pay real money for this, but in-game coins that you can find by   searching a level a little better than the average speedrunner would. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Each area has a number of new levels baked into an overworld that also contains a number of secrets that you can explore.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">No </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Playtonic</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> without tonic</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A   big part of your adventure in Yooka-Laylee is manipulating just about   everything around you. Both the gameplay and the appearance of the game   can be customized in various ways. One of the ways to modify the world   around you is through special potions called tonics. You can turn on a   number of tonics at once, causing the effects to pile up. For example, a   certain effect can be that the image becomes black and white. Or that   the controls change and the image is upside down. There are quite a few   different tonics that modify the game and certain tonics make the game   more difficult, others easier. Depending on the tonics you set you will   get a bonus or a penalty on your points income. By making the game more   difficult you will score extra points.By making the game easier you will   score less points.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The points are a bit as usual. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The ultimate goal is to complete the game with as many points as possible. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Outside of the tonics, there are a number of ways to manipulate the game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It is possible to completely change certain levels. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A   horizontal level is suddenly played vertically allowing you to collect   another bee to use as an extra life point in the Impossible Lair.</font></font><br> <br></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair takes a familiar 2D platform formula. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But puts in some fresh elements that give the genre a fresh look. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Thanks to the way the game is built, you always have your own challenge in your hands. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">And you decide when you take on the dangers of the Impossible Lair. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This brings you to a certain point where you have to consider playing through some levels. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Or to try it one more time with the lives you have now. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   colorful world and the fact that you can absurdly modify the game for   fun or for personal gain or loss make for some entertaining hours of   gameplay.</font></font></p></div>
