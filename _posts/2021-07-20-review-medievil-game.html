<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">MediEvil has risen from the dead! </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   fourth game in the series and already the third time that we get to   play the original story, but this time in a beautiful appearance. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Unlike Sir Daniel Fortesque&#39;s stature, MediEvil on the Playstation 4 is anything but skinny.</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   MediEvil you step into your skinâ€¦ into the bones of Sir Daniel   Fortesque, a &#39;hero-in-the-making&#39; so to speak. During his lively years,   he was the first to die on the battlefield from an arrow in his eye   socket. He was given a second chance when the evil wizard Zarok raised   an undead army. This is Sir Dan&#39;s second chance to stop evil, but he is   largely on his own. In the hall of the heroes all the great warriors are   already cast in stone, but Sir Dan&#39;s statue is still missing. Time to   change this!</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   story of Sir Daniel is set where it began 21 years ago. The remake is a   direct translation of the 1998 classic into a modern remake as we&#39;ve   seen with Crash and Spyro. So you have to think of the same principle,   although I think that MediEvil graphically still looks the strongest of   them all. Thanks in part to the dark, yet cartoon-like atmosphere that   the whole game brings. If you are familiar with the original Playstation   title, this MediEvil version will undoubtedly feel very familiar and   familiar. In almost all cases, the game plays exactly the same as it did   21 years ago. There are some subtle differences here and there, towards   the very end the differences are more noticeable for good reasons.The   finale of the original game was experienced as very simple at the time,   here they have adjusted a few things to make it more challenging. In   fact, she succeeded very well.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Not dead yet</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The announcement of MediEvil was a real surprise to many. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   franchise hasn&#39;t seen a light in 14 years, but the Zarok at Playstation   has finally found the right spell to breathe new life into this &#39;golden   old&#39;. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The franchise   improves in almost every way with this latest addition, although you can   sort out the ills of aging game design after such an entire   playthrough. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">As mentioned, the game is a remake of the original game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Brand new, strong HD and even 4K visuals, better gameplay, but still as faithful as can be to the original. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">So faithful that you can still use the old-fashioned guides on the internet to continue playing this game.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   addition, necessary adjustments have been made to the camera work and   viewing angles of the game that provide an even better picture and a   more over-the-shoulder look on the game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   far from above perspectives have largely all been removed, drawing you   even deeper into the dark, but beautiful surroundings of Gallowmere. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Together with the gruesome soundtracks and sound effects, it makes for a high-quality remake.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Reborn but not forgotten</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It   seems to have been a tough job to give MediEvil both fidelity and a   fresh look. For example, there are certain elements that are not very   common or desirable in modern titles. MediEvil is sometimes a mix of   both worlds, as you would expect from a remake of a game over 20 years   old. As I mentioned, most viewing angles have gone overboard, but the   levels are still intact in terms of design. This sometimes creates   curious situations where you get some uncomfortable viewing angles.   Maybe a little pick from the worst evil shall we say.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For example, levels in which you have to go through narrow corridors are often cluttered. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can hardly see behind you, which means that you cannot see certain entrances or exits. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Rotating the camera is also not possible in these areas because you have a fixed perspective in these places. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Fortunately, these moments are rare and you are generally in control of the camera. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Yes, the camera controls have been greatly improved compared to the demo. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This was my biggest fear after playing the demo. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Fortunately, this is all great.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Old and new</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">What makes MediEvil so good is not the gripping story or certain charm that Sir Dan brings with him. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s a skeleton. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">No, why MediEvil was chosen to resurrect is because of the beautiful game design. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game may be 20 years old, but as soon as you hold the game in your hands you won&#39;t notice anything. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">As soon as you place the original game next to it, you will see that it is exactly the same game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">MediEvil was preceded by an incredibly clever piece of design and the gamers of this generation deserve to experience it again. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Where many old titles fail over the years, MediEvil remains strong in both gameplay and overall design. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A timeless classic that doesn&#39;t need a remake, but deserves a lot. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">And because the eye also wants something, it is only a nice bonus.</font></font><br> <br></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">MediEvil </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">is   a rock-solid remake of classic heritage. Sir Daniel Fortesque feels   more alive than ever before and the world around you is a beautiful   sight. The variation in levels, increasingly challenging gameplay and   general form of continuation with minimal collectibles and rewards shows   just how strong the design of MediEvil is and still stands the test of   time. An old idea, but executed in a modern look and feel. A few points   of criticism do not detract from this strong experience that you can get   through within about 10 hours. The length feels just right for this   title when you add up all the side content. A great length where no   level feels like &#39;something like that again&#39;, but it always remains   refreshing with new elements and always new enemies. Sir Dan is not so   alive then,but MediEvil certainly does. Does this call for a remake of   part 2? We hope so.</font></font></p></div>
