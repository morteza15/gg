<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">After   a surprisingly successful launch on PC and Nintendo Switch, the   Waddling Goose hit Playstation 4 and Xbox One just before Christmas. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Of course we have not been left behind in the goose hunt and have taken a close look at the PS4 version.</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Untitled Goose Game</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> you take on the role of a wild goose. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s your job to stir up trouble in the nearby village and eventually win that shiny prize. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s not a long job, but it&#39;s not the easiest one either. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   short, but powerful and lively puzzle game keeps you busy with the   &#39;story&#39; for about 2 to 3 hours, after which you can perform a number of   extra challenges.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Untitled Goose Game</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">As   I said, you take on the role of a waddling goose to stir up trouble.   You don&#39;t just do this on your own initiative. Although it is very   laughable to mess around, the intention is that you cross certain   assignments off your list. The drop is divided into 5 levels. In each   level you get a checklist of assignments that you have to fulfill. The   infamous quest &#39;rake in the lake&#39; is one of these quests. You get this   in the first level. As the assignment suggests, your task here is to   throw a rake into the pond.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">While   executing these quests you are generally not doing the villagers a   favor, but on the contrary. For example, the gardener will immediately   chase you as soon as he realizes that you have his rake in your beak.   The trick is to distract the gardener first, or grab the rake unseen and   then mysteriously make it disappear.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   game is full of these kinds of puzzles where you have to move stuff, or   get a series of stuff in one location at the same time. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This way you have a shopping list with things that you have to put in a basket. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The assignment is only crossed off once all items are in the basket. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The trick here is to collect all the items before the person who owns these items realizes where these items are going. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If you are caught, this person will see all &#39;mysteriously&#39; disappeared items and they will be retrieved.</font></font></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Short but sweet</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   smart goose has waddled through the game within an hour or two. You can   continue with additional assignments and time races, but in principle   you won&#39;t see anything new after the first 5 levels you play. Afterwards   you can walk through the five levels to complete extra tasks or try to   solve each level within 6 minutes for a trophy. The extra assignments   can be quite tough and you sometimes have to think about this. This is   no different for the standard assignments throughout the story. Although   these are usually a bit more obvious.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   game starts fairly simple in the garden with the gardener, but towards   the end of the game in the cafe it quickly becomes a bit more spicy. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You are not allowed to be seen here by the staff of the cafe. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">As soon as they see you they will chase you off the terrain. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Strangely enough, you were less likely to be chased away in the previous levels. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Almost   towards the end of the story, all the levels come together and you have   to go back to the beginning to collect your loot. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Since   your loot makes noise while you run, all the inhabitants will come   after you, so you have to be extra careful during this final sprint.</font></font></p><h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Appearance</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game looks a bit like you&#39;re watching a cartoon. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The clumsy residents and how they deal with the goose and the world around them remind you a bit of a cartoon world. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It could just be a village from Buurman and Buurman. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The look of the game therefore adds a certain vibe to the game and how the game plays. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   somewhat unpredictability of the characters means that your second   playthrough for extra trophies, for example, will look slightly   different. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There are no   hard pre-programmed paths that the residents take, so you might   experience much more difficulty the second time with the infamous &#39;rake   in the lake&#39; assignment, for example. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This certainly also ensures that the game does not get boring, even if you have already spent a few hours in it.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Untitled   Goose Game is a short but very entertaining puzzle game where you can   definitely have some fun after playing the story. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There   are plenty of objects in the world that you can play with and make life   a bit miserable for all the residents by stirring up unrest like a   blazing goose is something you should have crossed off your own &#39;to-do&#39;   list. </font></font></p></div>
