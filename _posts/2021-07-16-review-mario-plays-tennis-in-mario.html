<p>&nbsp;</p><h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">One takes the Nintendo Switch, you pick up Nintendo's most popular character and you pick up a sport. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Voila, you have Mario Tennis Aces.</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">We packed our tennis clothes, the joy con as a racket and joined Mario and his friends for a nice game of tennis. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">But as soon as we started the game, we were immediately thrown into the middle of a Mario Tennis Aces story.</span></span></p>           <div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">            <div class="fitvids-video">                      </div>           </div>           <h3><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Story Mode</span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mario  Tennis Aces has a story mode. We start the story with a tennis  tournament in which Mario and Peach compete against Bowser and Bowser  Jr. The match is of course won by Mario and Peach. Wario and Waluigi  have a small present for Mario and Peach for winning the tournament. The  super strong and legendary racket from the Temple of Bask. But before  Mario and Peach can receive it, Luigi grabs the racket. This unleashes  an evil force that takes possession of Luigi, Wario and Waluigi. They  turn into possessed chrome versions of themselves. It's up to Mario to  stop this unknown evil force.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">And  what better way to stop this evil force than with a game of tennis.  Fortunately, the legendary racket from the Temple of Bask is not at full  strength. To achieve this, five power stones must be added to the  racket. Does this plot sound familiar? For those who have watched the  Avengers movie series, this is very familiar. Mario and Toad head out  together to make sure the racket doesn't reach its full strength.  Together they explore the tennis island they are on in search of the  five power stones.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">During your search for the power stones, you will encounter a number of tennis challenges. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">These range from matches against familiar characters from the Mario universe to skill shot related challenges. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">After each successful match or challenge you gain XP. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you have accumulated enough XP, you level up. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">With each level you level up, Mario gets better stats. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately, you cannot determine these stats yourself and the game determines on which stat Mario grows. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The challenges are well thought out and sometimes a bit on the spicy side. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">But not only the challenges are on the tough side. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The game does not have a certain difficulty level. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the way the level is raised is disastrous. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, the first area is quite easy to go through, but two areas later you are suddenly struggling against Blooper.</span></span><br /></p>           <h3><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Gameplay</span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  game tells you at the beginning that if you can't handle your level,  you have to go to the previous challenges to improve yourself. This in  itself is not so bad. But the further you get, the more you have to  grind to make Mario strong enough to beat the opponents. Because you  have to grind for it, the game no longer feels like a family-friendly  game. Besides the fact that you are almost forced to grind and play  challenges over and over, we come across another irritation point.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If  you don't pass a challenge or game, you have to start the entire  challenge again. There is no reset or direct restart function in the  game. This is very frustrating because every time you fail you have to  click through all the text. Fortunately, there is a skip option for the  challenge. But if Nintendo had just given a restart function in the  pause menu, a lot of irritation would have been saved. These annoyance  points are a real shame, because the game itself is quite entertaining,  at least when you play with a controller or in handheld mode.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mario Tennis Aces can be played in three ways. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can of course play it in handheld mode or with a controller. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">But you can also play the game in a dynamic way. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just like with the Wii and Wii U, you can play separately with the joy cons. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">With various swinging movements of your arm you can hit the ball back to your opponent. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, this way of playing is badly made. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Switch regularly registers the strokes you do not properly. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because of this, sometimes a smash becomes a lob and a lob becomes a sting ball. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, you often hit earlier in the game while your arm is still next to your body.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h3><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Verdict</span></span></h3>           <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mario Tennis Aces is a fun and entertaining game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you like a game of tennis, then the diversity of matches and challenges is fine. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The game also looks great. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">We see the graphic quality of Nintendo well reflected in this game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">As long as you play the game with a controller or in handheld mode. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Once you switch to dynamic mode, you get a ton of frustrations for free. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The grind and the occasionally disastrous difficulty levels should have stayed away from me. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">These really detract from what could have been a fun family friendly game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nevertheless, you will see me play a nice game of tennis with Mario Tennis Aces every now and then. </span></span><div id="tap-translate"></div>
