<h4>Civilization is one of the most famous turn based strategy games. For years, this game has been one of the most popular game in terms of civilization development. Recently, a new player has entered the market. Humankind is a similar game to Civilization. Compared to Civilization we see enough differences to make it seem like a not total copy in a different jacket. And that makes for a refreshing and a very entertaining game.</h4><p> <img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Humankind-2.png"></p><p> Humankind is from Amplitude Studios and is released by Sega. The game is very simple to learn but very difficult to master. This is partly because you can customize the difficulty level yourself. The bigger the map and the more opponents you put in the game, the more difficult the game becomes. In addition, you can also set the difficulty of the AI ​​to make it even more challenging. And of course you can also make the game easier by choosing fewer opponents or by setting the AI ​​lower. In that regard, there is plenty of options to find the right level that suits you.</p><p> The goal of Humankind is to let your little nomadic tribe develop into the largest and best civilization in the world. You do this, among other things, by collecting “Fame”. You collect fame by building settlements and building the necessary facilities in them. In addition, you also receive Fame for building wonders of the world or for defeating other civilizations. But too many conquests can also be detrimental to your Fame. You have a limit in the game on the number of settlements or cities you can own. If you go over that limit, you will lose Fame. But luckily you can return settlements to the free people to go back to your limit.</p><p> <img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Humankind-3.png"></p><h3> Develop and develop even more in Humankind</h3><p> In addition to building settlements, exploring the world and defeating other civilizations, you are also very busy developing your civilization in Humankind. When you have found a place for your first settlement, you can develop it into a city. Then you can choose from one of the historical civilizations you start with. Each civilization can only be chosen once and if another player has chosen a civilization before you, you cannot choose it again. The further you go, the more modern your civilization becomes. With each time period you move further in time towards the more modern civilizations. This way you create your own mix of historical civilizations, which shapes your civilization.</p><p> <img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Humankind.png"></p><p> Because you can choose different types of civilizations in each time period, no game is the same in Humankind. You can make a lot of different combinations of all the civilizations out there. The replay value is considerably increased by this. But in addition to the wide choice of civilizations, you also have to develop your armies. After all, your primitive archers lose out when you are surrounded by enemies that already use gunpowder. Science also needs a hand with development. Science gives you access to, for example, those musketeers who use gunpowder to shoot bullets instead of arrows. But science also yields new buildings and ways to increase your settlement limit. In short, development is a big thing in this game.</p><p> <img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Humankind-1.png"></p><p> We mentioned it briefly, in Humankind you are of course not the only civilization in the world. Depending on the number of opponents, there are a number of other civilizations you have to deal with. This can be done with the brunt of war or by ignoring them. But it can also be diplomatic. We soon noticed that diplomacy does not play a very big role in this game. The options during the negotiations are quite limited and minimalistic. We can clearly see that this has not received the most attention from the creators. With a number of extra options, this would have given more depth. Now it&#39;s so little that diplomacy is more of a nuisance to remember your turn.</p><p> <img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Humankind-4.png"></p><h3> Verdict</h3><p> Humankind is a successful turn based strategy game on most levels. We can finally say that a worthy competitor has emerged for Civilization. The choice of the numerous civilizations ensures that the replay value of the game is good. Because every time you play a new game, you want to make new combinations of civilizations and see how that plays out. In addition, you can also win the game in different areas, so that your strategies are also different every time. Learning this game is also quite easy. Mastering is a bit more difficult, but well worth it. Diplomacy in this game could have had a little more depth. Now it is a fairly simple menu and more of a necessary interruption than a really nice addition that you can get more out of. Hopefully this framework can be expanded with future updates. For now, Humankind is a great game to play if you want some variety from Civilization.</p><p> <img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Humankind-6.png"></p><p> The Post Review: Humankind: New Competitor for Civilization? appeared first on Gameich.com .</p>
