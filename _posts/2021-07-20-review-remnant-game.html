<div dir="ltr"><h4><span style="font-weight:400"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Remnant: From the Ashes is a Dark Souls-like RPG that lets you survive in a grim and chaotic world. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This third-person survival-action game is set in a post-apocalyptic world with some unprecedented enemies. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s up to you to stop the chaos in the world alone or with your friends. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Are you ready? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">We certainly do, and we want to tell you all about this unique title in our review of Remnant: From the Ashes.</font></font></span></h4>            <h4><b><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">story</font></font></b></h4>            <p><span style="font-weight:400"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Remnant   is set in a dark world, overloaded with chaos. Ancient enemies have   made their way into your world from other dimensions and it is therefore   the greatest goal to counter this evil. Humanity is fighting very hard   for survival, but possesses the technology to open portals to other   dimensions and realities. The story is told with lots of cinematography and   conversation. The game comes from Perfect World Entertainment, a studio   no stranger to the RPG genre. The game is made by Gunfire Games, known   from Darksiders 3 among others. So you already know what to expect!</font></font></span><br> <span style="font-weight:400"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The story doesn&#39;t go very deeply into certain aspects, but is interesting enough to keep you going. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The cinematics and conversations you have with NPCs are fun and you can choose your own answers. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">NPCs therefore react appropriately to the answer you give them. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This was great to see in a title that went under the radar for many. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But, the story is not the focus of this game, it is more with the gameplay.</font></font></span><br> </p>            <h4><b><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gameplay</font></font></b></h4>            <p><span style="font-weight:400"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Remnant: From the Ashes is a game that plays well. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can create your character in the beginning, male or female. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There are even some customization options here and there, including your hair style or skin color. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">After a short introduction you will soon be faced with the choice, which class will you take? </font></font></span><br> <span style="font-weight:400"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Are   you going for the Hunter, a real brain teaser with long-range weapons?   Or is the Ex-Cultist more your thing, a support with medium-range   weapons? Finally, you have the option to go as Scrapper, a close-range   tanky class with nice melee weapons at your disposal. Whatever you   choose, you don&#39;t want to try to survive Remnant&#39;s world alone. After   the tutorial you will find out that you can play the world of the game   with multiple friends. Together with two others you can fight the evil   of the four large zones. </font></font></span><br> <span style="font-weight:400"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You have to constantly upgrade your armor and weapons and you will also find or get several new weapons after boss fights. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You level yourself by investing trait points in different traits. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">These traits give you the opportunity to get more health or stamina, but this system goes a little deeper. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">So by discovering the world you get several new traits that you can level up, you can also discover these in the open world!</font></font></span><br> <br></p>            <h4><b><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Hey, that did awww!</font></font></b></h4>            <p><span style="font-weight:400"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You soon find out that the game is no joke and that boss fights and even wandering through sewers can give you a quick death. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Bullets are also scarce and you will have to keep picking up enough from your dead enemies. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">All loot you find in the world will automatically be shared with your team, except bullets. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This was a pretty nice addition and makes playing with strangers a less stingy experience. </font></font></span><span style="font-weight:400"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The boss fights have clear mechanics and you will get plenty of boss friends against you. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For example, I constantly died with two friends at the same boss. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This evil man called the Gorefist was a pleasant challenge for a first dungeon boss fight. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In the video review you will notice how I did it.</font></font></span></p>            <h4><b><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The world</font></font></b></h4>            <p><span style="font-weight:400"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   world of Remnant: From the Ashes was a pleasant surprise for Malvin.   You make your way through different zones and you can consider the game a   bit like a dungeon crawler. For example, you will have to backtrack to   open earlier ports, so that you don&#39;t have to walk around later, which   is handy! </font></font></span><span style="font-weight:400"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   world is divided into four major zones. Earth, or Earth, is in great   chaos, and you will have to fight the invasion here. There are three   other zones, each with its own atmosphere.</font></font></span><br> <span style="font-weight:400"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The same goes for enemy design. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Each zone has its own enemies with their own status effects that they can throw at you. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For example, it can sometimes be irritating to get sick of corruption, in which your character coughs its lungs out. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">These are all nice drawbacks that you can overcome with items but can make it challenging if you&#39;re not properly prepared. </font></font></span><span style="font-weight:400"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Items   like ammo boxes, Oilskin Potions, and Health Potions make it easier to   survive the world, but you&#39;ll run out of supplies in no time, so think   carefully about when to use something. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">At every checkpoint, all negative status effects will disappear and you will be completely better!</font></font></span><br> <br></p>            <h4><b><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></b></h4>            <p><span style="font-weight:400"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Remnant is a big game and in this review we have only mentioned a small portion of the features. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can see more about this in our video review, it will </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">appear </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">on </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">our channel</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> soon </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">All in all, I was positively surprised with a game that went well under the radar elsewhere. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Remnant   is a challenging but above all unique and fun experience and anyone can   pick up the game and have hours of &#39;fun&#39;, or break their keyboard. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game is challenging and has quite a few in-depth aspects. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The balance between items and traits feels fair and challenging from day one! </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">We can therefore strongly recommend the game to everyone!</font></font></span></p></div>
