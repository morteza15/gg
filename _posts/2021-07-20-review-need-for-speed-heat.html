<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Need for Speed Payback was not so well received by most fans. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game promised new life in a mediocre era for Need for Speed. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Unfortunately that didn&#39;t work. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But, will Heat be able to boost the franchise?</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Need for Speed Heat leaves a lot to be desired in terms of sales. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This may be because the franchise has deteriorated considerably over the years. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Fans expect a strong game this time, a racing title worthy of the competition. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The funny thing is perhaps that the competition is not so great in terms of quantity. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Games   like Forza Horizon, Dirt (Rally), and F1, despite each being unique in   their own way and quite different from each other, bring great quality. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Can Need for Speed Heat bring the franchise back to a worthy collective?</font></font></p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/04KPiGmC7Lc/maxresdefault.webp" width="546" height="307"><br><br>            <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">STOP! </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">POLICE!</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Something   that seemed quite unique was the ability to choose when you want to   race. During the day you mainly race for a lot of money, in the later   hours you mainly race for reputation. In the evening the police are   quite active and you will often experience chases. That seems a bit   weird, like the police aren&#39;t active during the day. However, this   creates a different atmosphere when you step into the waddle during the   day. The more you race in the evenings, the higher your &#39;heat&#39; level and   therefore the faster you attract police.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This   is also kind of where the story goes. The police are angry, very angry.   This ensures that the corps has received a budget for better cars.   These cars keep up with your race cars pretty well. This sometimes feels   a bit unbelievable, given that there is a certain catch-up system   behind it. But, a big plus is that even though the police drive a bit   too fast, the AI is a lot smarter than in Payback. You actually feel   being chased by someone who isn&#39;t already crashing into himself without   even realizing that you were being chased.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The story is somewhat above mediocre, as is the case in every race title. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You come in a crew, there is drama, end. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But, in Heat, I have to admit that the cinematics were quite fun and the characters have a good synergy with each other. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game feels riskier, and that&#39;s a good thing. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You don&#39;t just lose the police. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Which also makes sense if you follow the story. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s also quite rewarding to see your heat level go up, only to get rid of the police and get some nice rewards. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">All   in all, there is little to complain about in terms of storyline and the   police element has been handled much better this time around!</font></font><br> </p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The world</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Palm   City, the city that will make you unsafe day and night, is a double   aspect. The city looks fantastic, is quite large, has a sometimes   breathtaking color palette and offers enough content to blow through.   The flip side of this coin is that the city feels empty. And no, I don&#39;t   mean in terms of buildings. For a storyline that best focuses on the   police and public opinion towards street racing, there is surprisingly   little traffic in some spots and races. Besides that, you never see   anyone walking down the street, and that in a bustling city? These were   not immediately disturbing elements, but that makes the game feel a tad   incomplete.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Despite that, Palm City is a beautiful experience to experience and there is plenty to do. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   people who play a role in the story come to life in the atmosphere that   the city wants to bring and that alone is quite a plus. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You, of course, play an equally important role in this. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can choose from multiple avatars to play and dress them up the way you want. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">During my fifteen minutes with Need for Speed Heat at </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gamescom 2019</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> , I already found that the clothing options were quite extensive. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This has obviously not changed since launch. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Playing with how your character should look is a nice extra as an RPG player. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But also a nice addition for the shoppers among us. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But dressing up your character isn&#39;t the only cool thing about the customization.</font></font><br> </p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Build your dream car</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   Heat you can pimp every car into your own dream car. You can customize a   lot more than in most racing titles and this is a big step forward for   the Need for Speed franchise. By the way, you can&#39;t just do this via   your console of choice. EA has released an app where you can customize   your cars, right down to the frame. The app is a welcome addition for   the real fans who are constantly creating the most unique skins and   set-ups for their cars and to share with the community or on Reddit.   Whether the app will be a success remains to be seen, but it is more   than welcome! By the way, the skins made by community members can be   applied to your cars just like in Forza itself. Saves some effort!</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Unfortunately, the community doesn&#39;t seem very active when it comes to racing. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game gives you the option to play always-online or solo. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If you choose to play online, you can choose to compete with others at just about every race. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I haven&#39;t been able to do this often, though, as you won&#39;t find anyone to play with in most races. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This is unfortunate, as the challenge can be greater when racing online.</font></font><br> </p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Drifting b*tch</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The biggest relief while playing Heat is the car handling. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Your car has weight and you notice that immediately. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For example, there are several ways to &#39;drift&#39;. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">At   sharp turns you apply the handbrake and you immediately notice that the   game is an arcade racer, since you immediately slow down to the   direction you want to go with your joystick. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   can also ram the trigger twice to make a smooth drift. This takes some   getting used to, but feels so good once you understand how it works. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Driving   your car is perhaps the most important aspect of the game and you will   soon notice that the most attention has been paid to this, luckily!</font></font></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Ooh, colors</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Visually,   Need for Speed Heat is not the most beautiful racer on the market,   but it distinguishes itself with a great visual aspect: lights! </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game uses a lot of neon and a wide color palette and this gives character and atmosphere to the game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The reflection on the street during a rainy night also ensures that the game works graphically. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">During   the day you notice that the city is a sunny spa for racers and there is   a good distinction between the two parts of the day. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The cars also look tip top and there is little to complain about.</font></font><br> <br></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Need for Speed Heat</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> is a mixed bag of content for the big screen or the fast monitor. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game plays nicely and looks good but loses a lot of &#39;edge&#39; due to the focus on those two elements. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This makes the game feel incomplete or unfinished at the moment. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Still, Heat feels like a step forward compared to previous parts in these seasons. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If   the next title also focuses more on surrounding elements such as online   play, people walking around and story, it could become the best NFS in   years. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Unfortunately I have to deduct some points for those missing aspects. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Heat is well worth it, but not for the full blow in my opinion.</font></font></p></div>
