<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Tokyo RPG Factory releases a new action RPG under Sqaure Enix. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Can this title compete with other Japanese role-playing games? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Read it in our review about: Oninaki!</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Oninaki was released on August 22 on the Playstation 4, PC and Nintendo Switch. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   concept art for the title sparked a lot of interest from gamers who   like Japanese role-playing games, but there are so many of these games   out there and very few that execute it well. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">One thing is certain, Oninaki is stylish and explores dark aspects of the world. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But, is that enough to rise above the competition?</font></font></p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HvtPKoKYM1w/maxresdefault.webp"><br><br>            <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">story</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Reincarnation,   depression, death, fear, insecurity, all aspects that plague the world   as a taboo. For many it is difficult to talk about these topics. Some   people have never been in it themselves and many are too afraid to talk   about it. Oninaki is a title that aims to make aspects like these   discussable and that is a plus in itself. Where others turn off the   lights, the Tokyo RPG Factory turns the lights back on!</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   play as a Watcher, a sort of moral knight who wants to put spirits at   rest, instead of letting them wander in an eternal shadow of their   previous selves. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Ghosts   need to be reborn in Oninaki&#39;s world as a new person, a new life in   which you will hopefully not make the same mistakes as before. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Sometimes the story goes so far that you have to execute a living person so that they can find peace. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Touching all these topics will be a great relief for many players. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The way Oninaki&#39;s story is told is quite JRPG-esque, as linear as you&#39;d expect. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There are a lot of long dialogues and some of them go too deep into aspects. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But, despite the sometimes childish art style, it&#39;s just really nice that a game like this tackles subjects like depression.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gameplay</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   as a Watcher get your powers from so-called Daemons. These Daemons give   you a completely new play style. Aisha is your first Daemon. Aisha is a   master of katana and can perform quick attacks. You have a number of   other Daemons, including Izana. Izana loves swinging her big scythe and   she is very focused on attacking large groups at once. Each Daemon works   with a completely different play style and is very extensible. Despite   this, the combat itself gets repetitive pretty quickly. You don&#39;t do   much more than use three buttons at most to pulverize your enemies. This   is a shame as the enemies are quite well designed in terms of mechanics   as well as graphically.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Since the combat in Oninaki determines a fairly large part of the gameplay, the repetitive side of this is not to be missed. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It can make your playing session very short, purely out of boredom. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This is not such a big problem in the first hours of the game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However,   halfway through the story you really notice how repetitive everything   is and the story is also the only bright spot in the game at that   moment.</font></font><br> </p>           <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">graphics</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However,   the graphic part of Oninaki doesn&#39;t need a millimeter more love. The   environment, the enemies, the characters and everything about it is just   right. The drawing style is fantastic and the way the atmosphere is   conveyed is a breath of fresh air compared to so many AAA games that are   similar these days. Where the game is cheerful, you immediately notice   this in the environment. If it all gets a little darker, your impression   will change, trust me!</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The boss fights are extremely good in design and an aesthetic relief. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Sometimes   I thought of Furi, not because the game looks like that now, but the   boss fights in Furi were also a tour de force compared to the rest of   the game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The attack animations had a certain weight behind them, which naturally created a certain fear of dodging quickly. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The boss fights were a smooth experience, too bad that the rest of the gameplay was left behind. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The music in Oninaki also created the right atmosphere. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Where your environment was peaceful, so was the soundtrack in the background. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The same goes for the grim bits, the pathetic bits and the thrilling bits. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There was little to complain about in this area!</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Oninaki   is an aesthetically pleasing experience, but unfortunately held back by   repetitive combat and gameplay. The story involves certain social   taboos that not every publisher would want to touch, but here too the   game is a victim of linear translations in the generic JRPG style that   everyone knows by now. There is a lot of potential in the title and a   second part with better gameplay and a more dynamic way of storytelling   will certainly be a 9 out of 10, but unfortunately this is not the case   now. The game is definitely recommended if you like exploration,   thoughtful characters and a breathtaking drawing style, but   unfortunately leaves a bit too much on some aspects. </font></font></p></div>
