<div dir="ltr"><h4><strong>The launch of the Playstation 5 has added 2 fantastic platformers to the launch line-up. One of them is free, Astro&#39;s Playroom . This one served more as a controller demo, but Sackboy&#39;s story is a bit more extensive. Is it a worthy launch game? We think so!</strong></h4>  <h6><strong>Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a game that descends from Little Big Planet. This time the mascot is in a true platformer, which is not about building, but manipulating. How does that work? Read it in our review!</strong></h6>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sackboy-a-big-adventure-screenshot-05-disclaimer-en-01oct20.jpg"></p>  <h5><strong>Manipulate</strong></h5>  <p>A Big Adventure lets Sackboy live in a world with other pocketmen. This world, called Craftworld, was a peaceful one. Unfortunately, this was disrupted by Vex, who kidnaps all of Sackboy&#39;s friends. You will have to platform through a number of planets to save your friends. However, within a Little Big Planet title you would normally create to achieve your goals. However, this part is mainly a platformer. That does not mean that you should not often make smart use of your environment. You will have to do this in each level to find hidden objects or locations. Also, sometimes you use your enemies to get to places you normally would never be able to get.</p>  <p>These items consist of collectibles that you need for other items, trophies to simply progress. You can also find parts for making new outfits. You can freely combine these to make Sackboy your own. So you are not busy developing, but manipulating your environment. However, this feels limited, when you think back to the possibilities Little Big Planet used to have. But if you look at it for what it is, a platformer, it&#39;s another step in the right direction. The biggest advancement for Sackboy is the movement, where you can now walk around in 3D! This way Sackboy comes out better.</p>  <p>Sackboy is never a very difficult game, but sometimes it does make you think. Other than that, the game is pretty straight forward. Some levels are more challenging, but it is of course a game that is intended for both young and old. You will use different attributes throughout the levels such as a Jetpack and of course you can also hit as Sackboy himself. The game constantly throws new mechanics at you, which are quick and easy to understand, but which can really guarantee the freshness of the experience. One moment you&#39;re clinging to a flying object and the next you&#39;re jumping over shocking platforms and you have to react in time.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sackboy-a-big-adventure-screenshot-01-disclaimer-en-01oct20.jpg"></p>  <h5><strong>theming</strong></h5>  <p>Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a colorful game, but with its own palette. Colors are often pastel or very bright. But, especially the multiple themes that you come across are really fantastically developed. There is nothing to miss in style in A Big Adventure. The worlds are especially all very unique, but you can say that about the entire drawing style. Enemies have all been given a unique design and the worlds all look super detailed. The music also contributes to this, because it is recognizable from the Little Big Planet games. Even though you can&#39;t build yourself, all levels are really worked out with love, time and attention. This way you will never be short of creativity. You can also play the levels together, where even a number of levels have been specially developed. Multiplayer is also coming, someday.Besides the normal levels, which are already varied enough, the bonus levels and speedrun options will also continue to surprise you.</p>  <p>The assets used in Sackboy are all made up of different types of materials. You notice that the graphical power of the Playstation 5 plays a role in this. Details can be seen down to the seams when you play on this next-gen console. But especially the synergy between the drawing style and the music makes Sackboy a platformer with its own identity.</p>  <p>Sackboy himself can also be customized with various crazy or really cool outfits. Some of these outfits are subtle nods to first party Sony games, others are just plain funny or fun! It doesn&#39;t add much in terms of gameplay, of course, but it&#39;s always nice to be able to customize your character, this keeps the experience quite unique. The game makes minimal use of the Dualsense possibilities, which in itself is quite a shame. The game runs very smoothly at 60fps in 4K. This also makes the gameplay a bit smoother.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sackboy-a-big-adventure-screenshot-03-disclaimer-en-01oct20.jpg"></p>  <h5><strong>Verdict</strong></h5>  <p>Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a very cool game, which does not fall short of the Little Big Planet franchise. It shows the better elements from that franchise very prominently. By this I mean the creativity and love in the different worlds, the innovative gameplay in the platformer genre and the unique soundtracks. All these elements make for a very nice experience in playing the game. I can recommend him to anyone who likes platformers. If I have one point of criticism, it&#39;s the price. Sackboy is not a full priced game in my opinion. However, this will vary from person to person.</p>  <div id="gmail-tap-translate">Â </div></div>
