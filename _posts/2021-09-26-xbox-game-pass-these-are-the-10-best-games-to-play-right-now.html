<p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/want.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Yakuza-7.png" alt="Yakuza: Like A Dragon" class="type:primaryImage"></p><p> The Xbox Game Pass is a fantastic solution for many gamers . For â‚¬9.99 per month you get access to a collection of wonderful games that you can download and play. Not only older titles, but also future gems can sometimes be played immediately after release. As I said, a fantastic outcome.</p><p> Which games are only worthwhile on Xbox Game Pass in 2021? This is not only useful for people who are already using it, but also for people who are still in doubt about purchasing the subscription. In this article I will give you the answer.</p><h2> Xbox Game Pass: the 10 best games to play</h2><p> The following 10 games make the Xbox Game Pass worthwhile in my opinion. Even though this is always a matter of taste, I can&#39;t imagine that you can&#39;t get pleasure from one of the titles below.</p><h3> #1 Halo Master Chief Collection: Top of the Line on Xbox Game Pass</h3><p> If there is one series that you must have played as a gamer on the Xbox, it is without a doubt Halo. But where should you actually start? Well, at the Halo Master Chief Collection. The Xbox Game Pass gives you access to all the major Halo games that matter. You start with the story of Halo: Reach and end with Halo 4. Ideal, because this way you play one of the best shooters and most interesting campaigns the game landscape has to offer. </p><div class="article__content-image"><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/OHL-jJ2vODcE3iKJ-HDj43fzEeo=/335x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F10%2FHalo-The-Master-Chief-Collection.jpg 335w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/NC62vJzkzv2Jo6OhpBSF5NYguzk=/670x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F10%2FHalo-The-Master-Chief-Collection.jpg 670w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/SY_OuaokiZQXGVldOusO8bOwENA=/600x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F10%2FHalo-The-Master-Chief-Collection.jpg 600w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/-n7nC03I_CnvpLKlIZI1AOAY0yU=/1200x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F10%2FHalo-The-Master-Chief-Collection.jpg 1200w," sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 600px, (min-width: 768px) 560px, calc(100vw - 40px)" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/OHL-jJ2vODcE3iKJ-HDj43fzEeo=/335x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F10%2FHalo-The-Master-Chief-Collection.jpg" alt="Halo: The Master Chief Collection Xbox Series X" width="335" height="188" class="size-full wp-image-416321"><br><div style="text-align:center"> <span class="text">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</span> <span class="source">(Image: Microsoft)</span></div></div><h3> #2 Xbox Game Pass: Hades</h3><p> It doesn&#39;t matter who you ask, but if you ask people about one of the best rogue-lites ever made, the name Hades will probably come up. Even if the genre doesn&#39;t appeal to you very much, the game will attract you. The style, the gameplay and the story: everything is right about this wonderful game. The fact that the Xbox Game Pass offers it is actually reason enough to purchase it. </p><div class="article__content-image"><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/BAro4XN2ZNfjnDxZzT8AmwtAnN8=/335x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F08%2FHades-3.jpg 335w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/_jXZFxLhOnik-LYsfR8OBnOthq8=/670x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F08%2FHades-3.jpg 670w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/XsDWKITEGA5KC8OndXJ08XSXHWM=/600x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F08%2FHades-3.jpg 600w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/aE0zmvYHrXFn2C6icrsmViEa9Rs=/1200x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F08%2FHades-3.jpg 1200w," sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 600px, (min-width: 768px) 560px, calc(100vw - 40px)" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/BAro4XN2ZNfjnDxZzT8AmwtAnN8=/335x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F08%2FHades-3.jpg" alt="Hades 3" width="335" height="188" class="size-full wp-image-441171"><br><div style="text-align:center"> <span class="text">Hades 3</span> <span class="source">(Image: Supergiant Games)</span></div></div><h3> #3 Forza Horizon 4</h3><p> Forza Horizon 5 is yet to be released on Xbox Game Pass. However, its predecessor is without a doubt also worth seeing. When it comes to racing games, Forza is the jewel of the Xbox and that also applies to the game pass. This time you play in England and once again have to work your way up during the now famous festival. Ideal for playing alone, ingenious to do with a few friends. </p><div class="article__content-image"><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/k1A4iu7C0ZEKyDckb_PAfQPqDEE=/335x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F10%2FForza-Horizon-4-screenshots-1.jpg 335w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/QHlCJnQuCJRhMqLwk6uexzq0VOs=/670x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F10%2FForza-Horizon-4-screenshots-1.jpg 670w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/EfRYTmLyRb3PDOsBCBwiAygkGrg=/600x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F10%2FForza-Horizon-4-screenshots-1.jpg 600w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/PeEPBXEs05PU2Q4KquHyt9azQS8=/1200x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F10%2FForza-Horizon-4-screenshots-1.jpg 1200w," sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 600px, (min-width: 768px) 560px, calc(100vw - 40px)" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/k1A4iu7C0ZEKyDckb_PAfQPqDEE=/335x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F10%2FForza-Horizon-4-screenshots-1.jpg" alt="Forza Horizon 4 Xbox Game Pass" width="335" height="188" class="size-full wp-image-331191"><br><div style="text-align:center"> <span class="text">Forza Horizon 4</span> <span class="source">(Image: Microsoft)</span></div></div><h3> #4 Yakuza: Like A Dragon</h3><p> Yakuza: Like A Dragon is, as colleague Jelle said in his review at the time, very well put together. After the series seemed to come to an end, we could suddenly enjoy the story of Ichiban Kasuga. And that story should be reason enough to try this game in the first place. The best man has had a tough childhood and gradually ended up in the world of Yakuza. He went to jail innocently and returns 18 years later. Only then everyone has already forgotten him and he himself is betrayed. Time for revenge. </p><div class="article__content-image"><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/IAbBEu5VVhxRNgHaeWkWOx9x6ww=/335x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F10%2FYakuza-Like-a-Dragon-1.jpg 335w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/9NH8nIgWlLWs0H5po-qpxHLUgGs=/670x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F10%2FYakuza-Like-a-Dragon-1.jpg 670w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/CFMnJ9TnQ08e57eczho5iMjXeUU=/600x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F10%2FYakuza-Like-a-Dragon-1.jpg 600w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/FPetttPRUDdNsertCMr9yaE2b0g=/1200x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F10%2FYakuza-Like-a-Dragon-1.jpg 1200w," sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 600px, (min-width: 768px) 560px, calc(100vw - 40px)" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/IAbBEu5VVhxRNgHaeWkWOx9x6ww=/335x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F10%2FYakuza-Like-a-Dragon-1.jpg" alt="Yakuza Like a Dragon" width="335" height="188" class="size-full wp-image-415945"><br><div style="text-align:center"> <span class="text">Yakuza Like a Dragon</span> <span class="source">(Image: Sega)</span></div></div><h3> #5 Xbox Game Pass: Moonlighter</h3><p> Those who like to combine two things with each other, can without a doubt lose their mind with Moonlighter. On the one hand you are exploring caves, fighting evil creatures and collecting things. On the other hand, you are in your shop and you try to sell those things to people again. A wonderful combination that ensures that the Xbox Game Pass has just that little bit extra to offer. </p><p><img loading="lazy" title="Moonlighter | Official Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.youtube.com/vi/Hp7tNAH9Ox0/maxresdefault.jpg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></p><h3> #6 Sea of â€‹â€‹Thieves</h3><p> Those with an Xbox Game Pass should give Sea of â€‹â€‹Thieves a try. You have to play it for a long time, but at least make sure you&#39;ve given the title a chance. The game offers a fantastic world in which you as a pirate can decide for yourself exactly what you do. It doesn&#39;t matter if you want to loot ships, trade goods or go on a journey of discovery: everything is possible. </p><div class="article__content-image"><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/H2jvJem5cEJUHmyBBy89JhFr3b8=/335x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F02%2FSea-of-Thieves.png 335w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/AaF1Dl7KkvCI-ekh-W4-DqwBiDU=/670x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F02%2FSea-of-Thieves.png 670w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/Eunsauw_Fsd48ZZR53XokzLgmSk=/600x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F02%2FSea-of-Thieves.png 600w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/KQi08lyf_O62ZN3TpWvJxYaexf4=/1200x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F02%2FSea-of-Thieves.png 1200w," sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 600px, (min-width: 768px) 560px, calc(100vw - 40px)" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/H2jvJem5cEJUHmyBBy89JhFr3b8=/335x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F02%2FSea-of-Thieves.png" alt="Sea of â€‹â€‹Thieves" width="335" height="188" class="size-full wp-image-347136"><br><div style="text-align:center"> <span class="text">Sea of â€‹â€‹Thieves</span> <span class="source">(Image: Rare)</span></div></div><h3> #7 The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h3><p> If there is one game that has been milked out (besides GTA V), it is The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. And yet Bethesda&#39;s game continues to deliver fun. I have already played the game on five different consoles and fell for it again with my Xbox Game Pass. Whether it&#39;s the world, the story or the tens of hours you can spend in it: Skyrim is a wonderful game! </p><div class="article__content-image"><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/4WrSzsy7EbwE7KOJnPg1m5gQeb4=/335x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F07%2FSkyrim-2.jpg 335w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/P_20K7DgBWQYcEOjk6WjolnO3jE=/670x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F07%2FSkyrim-2.jpg 670w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/H21alfdJ6AA_xkAb1jGbboJB1zc=/600x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F07%2FSkyrim-2.jpg 600w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/BD1usuAK2oK8Rpf_OFCLZ6sNMq0=/1200x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F07%2FSkyrim-2.jpg 1200w," sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 600px, (min-width: 768px) 560px, calc(100vw - 40px)" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/4WrSzsy7EbwE7KOJnPg1m5gQeb4=/335x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F07%2FSkyrim-2.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="188" class="wp-image-438559 size-full"><br><div style="text-align:center"> <span class="text">There&#39;s bound to be something here</span> <span class="source">(Image: Bethesda)</span></div></div><h3> #8 Control</h3><p> The Xbox Game Pass has a lot of gems to offer and Control is without a doubt one of them. The game is regarded as one of the best of 2019 and ensures that action-thrillers fans are catered for. In the shoes of Jesse Faden, you will discover new powers and weapons and play the lead role in your own thriller. How cool is that? </p><p><img loading="lazy" title="Control - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.youtube.com/vi/F74LLDhAhhI/maxresdefault.jpg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></p><h3> #9 Xbox Game Pass: Gears 5</h3><p> In addition to Halo and Forza, there is another title that Xbox users must have played: Gears of War. The most recent part, Gears 5, is highly recommended in that regard. The game not only has a wonderful single-player mode, but also a fantastic multiplayer. So definitely worth the effort. </p><div class="article__content-image"><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/zRrgG1W680VP-U3gn5Q9_r7M6fg=/335x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F05%2FGears-Tactics-1.jpg 335w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/OLYX1Y7kKQfXebZkLSzmt7xoYpk=/670x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F05%2FGears-Tactics-1.jpg 670w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/kRQM86NvwYhSA9A2QXVdEIiUXNY=/600x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F05%2FGears-Tactics-1.jpg 600w,https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/_NUUSwLCCECMlpfaD_RQr_jSpZs=/1200x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F05%2FGears-Tactics-1.jpg 1200w," sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 600px, (min-width: 768px) 560px, calc(100vw - 40px)" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.want.nl/images/zRrgG1W680VP-U3gn5Q9_r7M6fg=/335x0/filters:quality(80):format(jpeg):background_color(fff)/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.want.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F05%2FGears-Tactics-1.jpg" alt="Xbox Game Pass" width="335" height="188" class="size-full wp-image-400259"><br><div style="text-align:center"> <span class="text">Gameplay is fine</span> <span class="source">(Image: Microsoft)</span></div></div><h3> #10 Viva Penata</h3><p> If there is one game that knows how to characterize the Xbox 360 like no other, it is somehow Viva PÄ«nata. If you don&#39;t feel like explosions, actions and hours-long sessions on the edge of the couch, you can get started with this fantastic game. In this game you get control over your own PÄ«nata garden that you have to shape. All your decisions have consequences and that just makes the game, which is already great, even more fun. </p><p><img loading="lazy" title="Viva Pinata Gameplay (Xbox 360)" width="500" height="281" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/img.youtube.com/vi/IeNAH6GasrI/maxresdefault.jpg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></p>
