<h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Destiny 2 Forsaken DLC ushers in Destiny 2's second year. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">New level cap, new gear cap, new gear and new sub classes. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">We're also saying goodbye to Cayde-6, but will this goodbye and the DLC save Destiny 2?</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Destiny 2 had a rough year. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The release of the base game wasn't too good. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although the story was good, the lack of end game material was a big loss to the game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the addition of the DLCs Warmind and Curse of Osiris, Bungie tried to increase the end game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Curse of Osiris was seen as one of the worst DLC for Destiny ever. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Warmind, on the other hand, brought some more end game material with him. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the fans were still not satisfied with the state of the game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">And Forsaken is changing that.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h3><span style="color: #ff7f00;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Story</span></span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Forsaken  is turning that around for Destiny 2. This time, Bungie hits the nail  on the head. Unfortunately, one of the most beloved characters had to be  sacrificed for that. Cayde-6 dies at the beginning of the new story.  Torn by grief and anger, you as Guardian take revenge on this attack.  Uldren Sov, Mara Sov's brother, is responsible along with his Barons.  The hunt takes you to a new planet in the Reef: The Forsaken Shore.  Supported by the Spider and Petra Venj, you hunt for the culprits.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The story is arguably one of the best in Destiny's history. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's especially immersive when you've been playing the game since the first Destiny. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You also develop feelings of revenge in yourself when you experience the death of Cayde-6. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">To then hear the first words of your Guardian is the icing on the cake. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Until now, your Ghost has always been the one to speak. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in this story, your Guardian speaks for itself. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you think the story is over, the story continues through an exotic quest. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">All in all, together with the second part of the story, you will certainly spend a good 15 hours on story this time.</span></span><br /> </p>         <h3><span style="color: #ff7f00;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">DLC content</span></span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">One  of the major criticisms of Destiny 2 was the end game. With the  addition of the Forsaken DLC, there is now no shortage of it. New Raid  The Last Whisper is now playable. In addition, you can collect weekly  and daily bounties from the Spider to kill special targets. Add to that  the daily hero challenges and the weekly strikes and nightfalls and your  evenings are filled with enough PvE options.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">But  for the players who like PvP, they too are catered for. The new game  mode Gambit is a mix between PvE and PvP. In Gambit you play in teams of  four against four. Each team gets its own field where they have to  defeat various enemies. Each enemy drops a mote which you can then pick  up and put in the bank. When you have collected 75 motes there will be a  boss that you have to kill. Whoever succeeds first wins the game.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">For many PvPers, the PvP element will certainly appeal. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">During this game mode you can hop through the portals to the opponent. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Once in your opponent's field, you can try to kill them and try to slow down their progress. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Players who carry motes and get killed lose any motes they had with them. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Once the final boss is there, you can get in the way of the opponents even more by continuously killing them.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h3><span style="color: #ff7f00;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Level caps and gear</span></span></span></h3>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In  addition to releasing a lot of new content, Bungie has raised the level  caps considerably. The level cap has gone from 30 to 50. In addition to  the level cap, you also have your maximum power cap. This has gone from  385 to 680. That's already two big caps to grind for. But that's not  all you can grind for your Guardian. New subclasses with new supers have  also been added to the game. Although you can get the basic upgrade  together in no time, the grind to the other parts of your subclasses is a  bit longer.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">We also see the addition of new weapons and a new ammo system. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thanks to the new ammo system, you are no longer stuck with the fact that your second weapon necessarily needs secondary ammo. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your second weapon slot can now also contain weapons that use the primary ammo. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bows are among the decidedly new weapons that the Forsaken DLC brings with it. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">A bow is a fairly strong weapon, but fires just as fast as a sniper. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">But you can also fire the bow in quick succession, but you will lose range and power of the weapon. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">For PvE it is a nice and strong weapon. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, for PvP, the weapon may be too slow to make good use of it.</span></span><br /> </p>           <h3><span style="color: #ff7f00;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Verdict</span></span></span></h3>           <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Destiny  2 Forsaken is the lifesaver for the game Destiny 2. The amount of  content and the great story will satisfy a large part of the fans. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately, we do say goodbye to a beloved character from the Destiny world. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cayde-6 your humor and ego will be missed. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The end game has finally been picked up well by Bungie. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the great story there is plenty to do in both the PvE world and the PvP world. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Gambit is a fun game mode to play for both PvPers and PvE-ers. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the price tag is an issue for many. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">40 euros for a DLC is quite on the pricey side. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In  addition, the fact that you also have to have the other two DLCs to  play Forsaken makes this DLC a pricey story for new players. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, after playing the DLC it is worth the money. </span></span><p>&nbsp;</p><div id="tap-translate"></div>
