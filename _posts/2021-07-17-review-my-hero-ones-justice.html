<div dir="ltr">  <h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This year is a great year for fighting games, with everything from FighterZ to Super Smash and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My   Hero One's Justice will also offer enough for the fans and brings a   unique perspective on controls, read all about it in our review!</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">no secret </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">that&nbsp; </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My Hero Academia is&nbsp;</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> a brilliant and rich anime. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It would therefore only be a matter of time before the series could receive its own game. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That time has come, and the game isn't half as bad anymore. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With   an anime so rich in character with different powers, characters and   looks, a game like this can only be necessary for the fans. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, that game is here, under the name:&nbsp; </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My Hero One's Justice</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>            <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rich in rich characters</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If   My Hero Academia's universe excels at anything, it's the characters.   The game also leaves a great first impression here. There are twenty characters available in the game. Each character has its own&nbsp; </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Quirk</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">   . These are special powers that make each character unique in terms of   playstyle and character. There is a nice balance of power, armor and   also visuals for each character that is playable. If you go into battle   mode you can also play directly with every character, except one.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></font></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><a href="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/GvbaLsUVmsA/maxresdefault.webp" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="450" data-original-width="800" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/GvbaLsUVmsA/maxresdefault.webp" /></a></font></font></div><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><br />&nbsp;</font></font><br /><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although   the game has a different playstyle than many others, certain things are   a bit of the same. There are three types of attacks. You have the   unblockable attacks, the normal attacks and the counter attacks. You   have to use this strategically, so this game is a bit slower than, for   example, the Ninja Storm games from&nbsp; </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Naruto</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">   . The learning curve is therefore a bit lower, but the button   combinations on the Nintendo Switch are slightly more dependent on   timing and therefore a bit more difficult compared to some button   bashers. During battles you notice that you create openings faster than   in many other fighting titles, this makes the game less competitive, but   nice to play a few games.</font></font><br /> <br /><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each   arena has destructible elements, which gives you that little bit of   goosebumps when you throw enemies against the wall or right through the   wall. What's a funny addition is that you can throw enemies into the   wall with their heads, leaving them stuck in that wall for a few   seconds. This not only gives an opening to throw heavy hitters, but also   creates a funny effect. Despite the fact that the battles can sometimes   feel a bit clumsy, the game plays nicely. Anyone can pick up this title   and level their opponent to the floor. So there is little depth to the   mechanics, this can be seen as both an advantage and disadvantage. In my   case this was more of an advantage, a temporary escape from more   difficult titles like FighterZ or Ultimate Ninja Storm 4. I think, for a   first My Hero's title,it is looking in the right direction.</font></font><br /><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The storyline is unfortunately not the strongest point in the game. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The story is largely voiced, which is very cool, but the use of cinematics is not always cool. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you're in the main menu, you immediately notice that the game looks very manga-like. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As in, a lot of comic graphics are used. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is great in itself, but it doesn't always work as immersive in the story. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This made the story feel slower than it needed to be. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think if they had left this out, it wouldn't have been that bad. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately, the story didn't quite come across that way.</font></font><br /> <br /><p></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Graphics and the Switch</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Time   and again, the Nintendo Switch proves why the handheld is the strongest   on the market. Of course, Nintendo hasn't really had a lot of   competition in terms of handhelds in recent years. But beyond that, this   game once again proves how strong the Switch is. Gameplay plays   wonderfully and smoothly, without any frame drops. Not even when there   were patches of ground or wall flying everywhere, when there were&nbsp; </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Michael Bay-esque&nbsp;</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> explosions, even then there was no sign of any loss of frames.</font></font><br /><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The characters all look beautiful, unfortunately I can't say the same for some textures. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of   course the textures are not the most important thing in fighting games,   but in some maps the contrast between beautiful and ugly can be very   thin. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you compare it to other titles in the genre, it seems like My Hero One's Justice doesn't quite know where it stands yet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I don't mean this in terms of gameplay, it's very clear there. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if you look purely at the graphics, there is little to notice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's hope this will turn out a bit better in a possible sequel.</font></font><br /> <br /></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My Hero One's Justice is a game for everyone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It has little depth, but just plays well. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This may also be sometime. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The game runs very smoothly on the Switch, but unfortunately has left some points behind in terms of graphics. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The camera angles can sometimes be a bit tedious, but the calm and smooth-running combat makes up for a lot. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If   the story wasn't told so slowly, it could also turn out much better and   create more new fans for a franchise that is just super strong. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All in all, I can definitely recommend the game to fans of the series and people who want something simple. </font></font></p>    </div>  <div id="tap-translate"></div>
