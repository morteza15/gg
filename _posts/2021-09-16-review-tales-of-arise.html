<h4>Tales of Arise is Bandai Namco's newest JRPG and newest addition to the 'Tales of' franchise. In this brand new JRPG we see how the popular series has evolved to become the best entry yet in the legendary series.</h4><p>From start to finish. From intro animation to finisher move. And from footsteps in the grass, to the many beautiful soundtracks. Tales of Arise exudes a polished video game through and through. It is a relief to see a beautiful piece with so much dynamics, working in so many accurate details with minimal mistakes. To get straight to the point, this is undoubtedly Bandai's best JRPG to date. In this review we explain why.</p><p>The ' Tales of ' franchise is a JRPG series in the same vein as Square Enix's Final Fantasy series. This means that you don't need to have played any previous game to follow the story. Each installment takes place in an entirely new area, with an entirely new cast of characters. Some parts refer to each other and are related in some respects, but it is never such that one part is dependent on the other. This makes Tales of Arise a perfect game for the veteran. But also for the curious player who has never played a Tales game before.</p><p>Not only in terms of individual parts, Tales is very accessible to new players, but also in terms of gameplay, Tales is more accessible than ever.</p><p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tales-of-Arise_20210914170307-scaled.jpg" alt="Forest Area" width="2560" height="1440" /></p><h2>A well-known building block</h2><p>Tales of Arise is a Tales game through and through. This means that it is built with the same building blocks that we are used to from previous parts. It builds on an already well-functioning formula, but applies improvements to make the experience even better. Compared to the previous installment, Tales of Berseria, from 2016, we see major-caliber improvements in pretty much every way.</p><p>The games and therefore Tales of Arise are built quite simply. You follow a linear story according to a fairly linear map, but with just enough freedom to explore. You can also always return to previously visited areas for side quests, resources, collectibles, or just because you want to take a look around. the world is divided into regions and each region has its own open areas separated by passageways. It is therefore not a real open world, although you can always decide for yourself where you go and stand. For the big story, however, you mainly follow a linear path.</p><p>The areas in Tales of Arise are very diverse. Each region carries its own theme. So you start in a kind of wasteland with a very industrial look. Then in the next area you trek to an icy valley with a town where it is almost always dark and winter. Another area takes you to a bustling city full of visible life, surrounded by lawns, forests with giant trees and wide arches that span the landscape. So a typical JRPG setting. All in all, you are constantly looking forward to the amazing painting-like views that Tales of Arise paints for you. Before you feel like you've seen enough of the current region, you're greeted with a completely new atmosphere in a completely different thematically. It is simply beautiful.</p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tales-of-Arise_20210910213026-300x169.jpg" alt="Tales of Arise" /><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tales-of-Arise_20210911234805-300x169.jpg" alt="Tales of Arise" /><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tales-of-Arise_20210913212119-300x169.jpg" alt="Tales of Arise" /><h2>In brief</h2><p>Without revealing too much, the story in Tales of Arise revolves around a conflict between two population groups. As we see from past Tales games, the story is a bit dramatized and somewhat related to conflicts that are not completely unknown to us in real life. This time it concerns an oppressed population that is supposedly inferior to the other population group.</p><p>The Renan in this case is the oppressive population group and the Dahhnan the oppressed. They are often used as slaves or cheap laborers. The Renans, on the other hand, are an elite population who pull the strings everywhere. As an oppressed Dahnanse slave, one day you decide enough is enough. You break free from your oppressors and set the goal to take out all rulers to stop the oppression. During your quest for all rulers, you will meet many characters and form unlikely allies.</p><p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tales-of-Arise_20210913173933-scaled.jpg" alt="Tales Party"/></p><h2>Full of character</h2><p>The great thing about Tales of Arise is that there is a lot of interaction between the different characters. The further you progress in the story, the bigger your company becomes. You can equip your entire party with new weapons, armor, accessories for unique bonuses, as well as costumes and dressing. If you've played previous Tales games, you probably know what to expect in this area.</p><p>The many moments of interaction, many of which are optional, add immense context and deepen the story through background stories and certain ways of interacting between the characters that depend on the type of character. The extra layer and depth in combination with the personal adjustments make the overall experience very personal and fascinating. Not a dull moment goes by in Tales of Arise. You are constantly in the action, or in moments where you get to know the world, the story or the characters around you better.</p><p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tales-of-Arise_20210914231611-scaled.jpg"  alt="Tales Skits" /></p><h2>Entertaining Combat</h2><p>The interaction between characters continues in the battles of Tales of Arise. Before we get into this, let's take a step back. The combat in Tales of Arise is real-time action-based. With R1 (on the Playstation) you do a standard attack and with the face buttons (square, triangle, cross) you do Artes. These are special attacks that you can configure per character. You can configure them for ground and airborne attacks. As you progress through the game you unlock more and more fields in the different skill nodes for each character and then unlock them for use. Each Art is a unique attack with a unique animation and unique effect or element.</p><p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tales-of-Arise_20210915193914-scaled.jpg" alt="skill nodes" /></p><p>Furthermore, characters can perform boost attacks. These are kind of signature moves of the characters that also have unique effects. For example, a certain character can knock enemies that are charging an attack off balance with her boost attack. As a result, they can't make their attack, future charged attacks do less damage and they are 'downed' for a while, so you can temporarily deal extra damage.</p><p>If enemies take a lot of damage and the closer to death they are, the faster a given meter will fill up. Once this meter is full and you press a button on your d-pad, two of your teammates or more will launch a stylish combo attack that always kills standard enemies.</p><p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tales-of-Arise_20210914233307-scaled.jpg" alt="combat tales" /></p><h3>accessible but profound</h3><p>Each character plays very differently and has his/her own strengths and weaknesses. Experimenting with different attacks and characters makes for an ongoing quest for the most brutal team setup. The combat system is also quite detailed, but up to the higher difficulty levels you don't really have to pay attention to this. In Moderate, you are somewhat expected to put a little thought into your attack and team composition. Of course a lot more if you play on Hard. On Easy and Normal, the combat is especially stylish and you don't have to worry so much about how you approach fights. You can switch between these modes at any time, so be sure to try them all out and choose the one that works best for you.Personally, I found Moderate to be a perfect balance for a steady pace through the game with a pleasant challenge in the big boss fights.</p><p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tales-of-Arise_20210910232526-scaled.jpg" alt="Lord Balseph"  /></p><h2>Verdict</h2><p>Tales of Arise is without a doubt the very best Tales of game to date. The franchise has developed so much in the past 5 years that it becomes very difficult to restart previous parts. From sound effects to the soundtrack to the beautifully visible details in the world to the refined combat. Everything is right, works flawlessly and is to a certain extent adjustable to personal preference. This actually applies to your entire playthrough. Where on the one hand the story is very linear, you play it at your own pace, the game offers you enough freedom, but you are not released too much to miss the target for longer than 5 minutes. The so-called 'dog leash' keeps you in tension from the first minute to the very last.</p><h5> Played on Playstation 5 </h5><ul><li>The best Tales game yet! - 9.2/10</li></ul>
