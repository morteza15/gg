<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The RPG Genre, ah, what a two-sided phenomenon we find ourselves in. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In this genre you can screw it up or take it all in, but there&#39;s no middle ground. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Or is it?</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Greedfall came out on September 10th and after a long playthrough this game left me in doubt. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">After a long period of trailers that promised a lot for the game, the hype was great, sometimes immense for many. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">After   a long period of sitting in disbelief I gave in, the latest trailers   for Greedfall got my well-deserved attention and eventually even a lot   of hype. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But, who would have thought that a game could have so many problems, but be so much fun at the same time.</font></font></p>            <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">story</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A   disease reigns over the country, besides that overpopulation is also a   thing in itself. As if that weren&#39;t enough, poverty is also just around   the corner. Political scenes are the order of the day in Greedfall and   you notice this from the first moment. In the beginning you start by   creating your character, the choices are limited, but good enough. It&#39;s   up to your character to find an opportunity to live with or flee from   the problems in &#39;The Old World&#39;. There are stories of an island, a land   free of the pests and diseases that lurk around every corner in this   so-called ancient world. While you search for a solution, you come   across different problems, challenges and solutions.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The world of Greedfall is grim, in a good way. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The architecture and setting are in a 17th century European setting, something quite unique for an RPG with fantasy elements. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However, in the world you will encounter many different types of enemies, beasts, mysteries and areas. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In this aspect, the game has a big plus. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Spiders   Games succeeded in mixing an unusual setting with an atmosphere   creation that we are used to and every area fascinated me again. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Magic is a big aspect of the game and it shows throughout the storyline.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A Core RPG</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Greedfall   is, as promised, an RPG with many core elements. These are features   that we are used to from OG role-playing games from the past. You have a   certain freedom that many games lack these days. However, it takes a   few hours before you can actually experience this free feeling. The   classless progression system, as Spiders calls it, enriches the   gameplay. You can immerse yourself in multiple skills and so you have   more freedom to create your own hero. Customizing your clothes is also   such a fun, unique aspect. It is not the case in greedfall that you are   constantly looking for new armor, clothing or weapons. No, it is   precisely the intention that you can expand current clothing. You can   add pockets for extra space and padding for extra armor.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   combat is where it gets a bit clumsy. The camera can&#39;t be tough at   times, movements feel downright clumsy and the fights sometimes feel   like it&#39;s &#39;not supposed to be that way&#39;. Other than that, all attacks   look cool and, for example, a gunshot has real impact. It feels great to   blast someone with a load of gunpowder spewing from your handgun like a   Saturday night dragon gathering! This is where the reverses of the coin   started to alternate more often.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can choose multiple factions in Greedfall, each with their own goals, norms and values. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   will be recruiting people to accompany you on your path to a better   world and you will have to make diplomatic choices with that idea in   mind. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Your recruited   allies can betray you if you don&#39;t give them enough attention or stand   up for them and that&#39;s an element that has been worked out well. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Every choice you make can anger or reassure other factions. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Also, your allies can make ecological changes in the world. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">These systems work great and if this hadn&#39;t been done a little better, the game could have been carried on purely here.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Budget is a thing</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Spiders   is a studio known for games like the Technomancer and Bound By Flame.   These are all games that just can&#39;t bear the title &#39;Triple A&#39;. Greedfall   swings just over that edge and may be on that infamous AAA list, but   really with heels over the ditch. You notice that there is a heart for   the cause and that the game distinguishes itself on many fronts, at the   same time you cannot avoid the fact that the game could have handled its   budget cuts differently. The movement, camera and combat just doesn&#39;t   feel great at times. Your character&#39;s walking looks like you just   tripped over a sack of potatoes and now your big toe hurts. The camera   sometimes changes just a little too fast or not fast enough at   all.Beyond that, there are simply missing aspects that have made room   for a form of uniqueness and self-esteem. At first glance there is   nothing wrong with that, but still, if the game had been given more   budget or maybe even more time, it could have been better.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Cinematics is also such an example, everything feels so scripted and the dialogues don&#39;t fall into a good &#39;flow&#39;. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">NPCs keep walking the same circles and paths or suddenly stop randomly and then do nothing. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">These are aspects that quickly ruin an impression that is actually very strong. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game is full of bugs and teething problems that you can hardly overlook. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This   is the most disturbing aspect of the entire game and if more attention   had been paid to this, the game would have gone down in the history   books as arguably the most unique RPG ever. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Unfortunately this is not the case now.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Graphics and Sound</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">except   for some blurry textures, Greedfall is a breathtakingly beautiful game,   especially for the genre in which the game is located. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Enemy design is varied and gives a clear picture of the danger that is coming your way. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The clothes and weapons all have unique looks and can be expanded in fun ways and I could go on and on. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   lighting is beautiful and the environment gives a nice grim atmosphere   when necessary, but can also look nice and sunny the other way around. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Sounds are a double thing, footsteps and spoken dialogues are of mediocre quality and not always fantastic. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">On the other hand, sounds in combat and the shooting of your gun are nicely picked up again.</font></font></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Greedfall   could have been so much more than it has become, but despite all the   bugs, flaws and technical minorities it was an enjoyable game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I could play for hours on end and at times even put all minorities aside for the unique aspects that the game contains. </font></font><a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=nl&amp;tl=en&amp;ajax=1&amp;elem=1&amp;se=1&amp;u=http://greedfall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Spiders</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> is not an AAA studio and can deliver better quality with a low budget than average large studios and developers. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This in itself is worthy of applause and Spiders is definitely heading in the right direction. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can tell that a lot of love has been put into the game and despite the technical minorities it is a very unique experience. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Every RPG fan should definitely give this game a chance for the price.</font></font></p></div>
