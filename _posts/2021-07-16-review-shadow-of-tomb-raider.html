<h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">With Shadow of the Tomb Raider, the trilogy comes to an end. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">And what a beautiful ending it is.</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shadow of the Tomb Raider, as everyone knows, revolves around Lara Croft. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the first two parts she has grown into a true “Tomb Raider”, and this is also reflected in the game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You see a more grown-up Lara dealing with the situations presented to her.</span></span><br /><br /></p>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Story:</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Where  in Rise of the Tomb Raider we thought that with defeating Konstantine,  Trinity was finally over, this turns out not to be the case. In notes  from Lara's father, she finds out that Trinity is on the Mexican island  of Cozumel. She and her boyfriend Jonah go to Cozumel and run into  Dominguez. From this point on you will start to get more information  about what Trinity is up to there.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Apparently Trinity is after a special dagger related to an ancient Mayan ritual called "cleansing". </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lara finds the dagger first. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order not to let the dagger fall into Trinity's hands, she takes it with her. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">With this, she unleashes the first of four "curses", a major tsunami that destroys the island. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">When  things go wrong, she has to give up the dagger and start the hunt for  Trinity and prevent them from getting to the final goal earlier. </span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shadow of the Tomb Raider is first and foremost about the story. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a completely linear story where you can only go one way most of the time. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is sometimes interrupted by open places for you to explore and find items</span></span><br /><br /></p>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Gameplay:</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  game is a joy to play. The various elements of the gameplay have  clearly been well thought out and the balance in this is fine. There are  a few quicktime events throughout the game. And as someone who hates  quicktime events, I didn't find it disturbing in this game. It is rare  and almost always supports the story. </span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">I  set the difficulty to normal. For me personally this is way too easy. A  nice advantage with this game is that you can set the degree separately  for puzzles and battles. In this way you can set exactly what you like.</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can finish battles in stealth or run guns blazing into it. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Again, you get several ways to play from which you can choose. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This way they appeal to a larger audience who can like this game and give the game a somewhat better replay value. </span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is also a large Skill Tree present. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here you have skills that you unlock as you progress through the game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">But of course there are also skills that you have to buy yourself with skill points. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">This way you can upgrade Lara to your way of playing.</span></span><br /><br /></p>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Atmosphere:</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The  combination of beautiful graphics and a good soundtrack ensure that you  are completely absorbed in the game. Whether you're running through the  forest in Peru or hanging from a ledge in a crypt. You really do feel  like you are there. I played the game on a standard PS4 and the graphics  are already blowing my mind. What they get pushed out of such a PS4 is  impressive. What also needs to be mentioned separately is the water. How  this looks is also a gem in the game .</span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">What could have been better in my opinion is the styling of the crates and jars that you can open. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each type of item is then in a different object, but each crate or jar is exactly the same. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There could have been a little variation here. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Likewise when Lara walks through water that is only knee high, but then starts wading with her arms. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">These are some small points that struck me, but they don't detract from how well the game is put together.</span></span><br /><br /></p>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the collectors and completionists:</span></span></h4>           <p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There's a lot to collect in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can find relics, murals, diary pages and other documents. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can also find images and objects that teach you a language and help you further in the game. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything is quite easy to find and if this doesn't work, you can also find a map in the game with the locations on it. </span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are also side missions. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">They could have easily added these side missions to the linear story or left them out altogether. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It comes across as filler to me. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Throw in some side missions to extend the playtime. </span></span><br /><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">When we talk about filler, the challenge missions also come up. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another useless thing. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shoot five things from a tree, challenge complete.</span></span></p>           <h4><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Verdict:</span></span></h4>           <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">A great ending to a trilogy. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">Strong and compelling story that you can jump right into without playing the first two games. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The game creates a good atmosphere with the beautiful graphics, tight soundtrack and beautiful environments. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The filler, on the other hand, is unimpressive and feels thrown in. </span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">All in all, the game is very entertaining and highly recommended to play. </span></span><p>&nbsp;</p><div id="tap-translate"></div>
