<div dir="ltr"><h4>Dungeons and Dragons has been a source of inspiration for game developers for years. Not just the way a story is told or what fantasy animals and races come into play. The way of playing Dungeons and Dragon is also a source of inspiration.</h4>  <p>Earlier this year we reviewed a parody of Dungeons and Dragons called: The Dungeo of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet of Chaos . Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is the serious interpretation of the immensely popular tabletop game, and you can read what we thought of it here.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Baldurs-Gate-32.png"></p>  <p>Before we start the review, we would like to point out that the game is still in Early Access. This is the version we played. We can let all bugs and issues affect the game, but that&#39;s not entirely fair. Of course it was occasionally annoying that you had to replay parts because the game crashed during cutscenes or the animations don&#39;t run smoothly, T-posing dead enemies etc. but Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is a great game for those who like RPG elements and likes to play Dungeons and Dragons. Even if you don&#39;t play Dungeons and Dragons yourself, the game can be recommended. Perhaps your interest in Dungeons and Dragons will be sparked just to play it.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Baldurs-Gate-31.png"></p>  <p>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is simply Dungeons and Dragons in a digital game jacket. The way of playing, having conversations and creating your characters are all in the same vein. However, you don&#39;t see them when you&#39;re in a fight. You can see what has been thrown behind the scenes on the attacks that have been made. The advantage of the game is that you don&#39;t need a Dungeon Master. You can play the game with three other friends or on your own. It doesn&#39;t matter how much you play the game, because the game is great alone and with multiple players.</p>  <h3>Gameplay Baldur&#39;s Gate 3</h3>  <p>Above we already briefly discussed the gameplay of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Time to roll for a further inspection: 17. Top with a 17 we can give enough information about the gameplay. In the game you create your own character via a so-called Character Sheet. In this you show what your character looks like and what his class and race is. In addition, you can choose from various options to make a Wizard, Cleric or a Fighter, for example. This includes handing out points in certain character traits such as Charisma, Strenght and Wisdom. When you&#39;re done with your character, your adventure begins. After the intro you get an explanation how to control your character and what you can do with your character. Once past the explanation, your adventure really begins and you are free to go where you want.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Baldurs-Gate-37.png"></p>  <p>Actions and behavior have a lot of influence on the world of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. And in that you are completely free with what you do. This can cause easy solutions or difficult problems depending on what you&#39;re doing. For example, interacting with NPCs is one of the ways you can influence things. But this comes with your character traits and a roll of the dice. Some speech options require a certain property. The better you are at that quality, the easier the role is for you and the more likely you are to succeed and vice versa. But even with those speech options, the effect can sometimes be different than you hoped.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Baldurs-Gate-36.png"></p>  <p>In the battles you also use the dice, but they are thrown in the background. You can find these in the combat box in your screen. The battles are conducted in a turn based manner. Actions and bonus actions are performed in turn. In addition, you can walk and move around the map and use the environment. The story of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 revolves around finding a cure to save you from an insect planted in your brain. During your quest you will meet other characters who have the same problem as you. Together you will continue on your way to a cure.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Baldurs-Gate-35.png"></p>  <h4>Verdict</h4>  <p>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is a good digital version of Dungeons and Dragons. All elements are well incorporated into the game. The way in which you can make choices and for the times you roll a dice are well worked out. I personally had seen all the rolls of the dice, but I can well imagine that they didn&#39;t do that to make the fights go faster. The characters in the world are provided with interesting backgrounds that lead to new missions. In addition, you CAN pet dogs in the game. If that&#39;s not a reason to play the game, then I don&#39;t know what is.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Baldurs-Gate-3.png"></p>  <p>Baldur&#39;s Gater 3 does need a few things to achieve a stable good game. Fortunately, the game is in Early Access and we can only hope that most of the problems will be fixed once the game actually comes out. Whether or not you are a fan of Dungeons and Dragons this game is entertaining to play. RPG elements are fine and not too extensive, the choices you can make provide enough variation and therefore gives the game a replay value. The game may score higher once it actually comes out, but until then we&#39;ll give it a 7.8.</p>  <div id="gmail-tap-translate">Â </div></div>
