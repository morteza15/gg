<div dir="ltr"><h4>Not only did Assassin&#39;s Creed: Valhalla appear recently, which we are very excited about by the way, but a board game also appeared in the franchise. Stratego: Assassin&#39;s Creed is your old trusted Stratego, but with an Assassin&#39;s Creed jacket.</h4>  <p>Most people are familiar with Stratego. It is a board game that you play with two players. You always play against each other and your goal is to capture the opponent&#39;s flag. In the case of Stratego: Assassin&#39;s Creed, you have to conquer the Apple of Eden. This apple has a special power, if you play the special version of Stratego in this Assassin&#39;s Creed version.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Stratego-AC3.jpg"></p>  <h2>strategy</h2>  <p>Stratego is a strategy game in which the placement of your playing pieces and your tactics are the key to winning. Your playing pieces contain &#39;soldiers&#39; of different ranks. Rank 1 through 10, where rank 1 is the spy and rank 10 is the marshal. If the spy attacks the marshal, the spy wins, but otherwise the spy always loses. A very vulnerable, but very valuable game piece. Number 2 is a scout and can always move more than one square in a straight line. You immediately give away the identity of your playing piece, because no one else can take more steps at the same time. Number 3, the minor, is the only game piece that can defuse bombs. Since the flag is usually protected by bombs, these game pieces are also very valuable.</p>  <p>While playing, the other&#39;s highest rank always wins. You are not required to attack, but if you do, the highest rank wins. If you attack with the same rank as the piece you are attacking, both pieces are finished. Bombs are not allowed to move and the flag always remains stationary. As soon as you attack a bomb you are always finished, unless you attack with a minor.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Stratego-AC1.jpg"></p>  <h2>Assassin&#39;s Creed</h2>  <p>Stratego: Assassin&#39;s Creed is really just a skin for the traditional board game. It works exactly the same, but the game board and game pieces are based on the Assassin&#39;s Creed franchise. Bombs are bombs, the flag in this case is the Apple of Eden and guess who the Marshal of the Assassin&#39;s is? Right, it&#39;s Ezio Auditore. In the Assassin&#39;s Creed version you play as you expect with the Assassin side, or with the Templars. With the Templars, Cesare Borgia as Marshal.</p>  <p>You mainly play with members of the Brotherhood and you have game pieces from mainly the Ezio trilogy, so Assassin&#39;s Creed 2, Brotherhood and Revelations. There are a few exceptions, such as Shao Jun as a spy from the Assassin side. Although she does not appear in the trilogy, she is part of the Chinese Brotherhood.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Stratego-AC4.jpg"></p>  <h2>Strategy Special</h2>  <p>So far you play your Stratego with an Assassin&#39;s Creed skin, but there is also a special mode in which the powers from paradise come to the fore. The game plays mostly the same, but with some minor tweaks, including:</p>  <ul><li>Veil of Paradise – If the spy is captured, you may place another piece back into the field. You may replace one piece. You can choose from pieces between ranks 2 and 10.</li><li>Sword of Paradise – All captains, rank 6, may attack two pieces at a time. You attack the weakest piece first, then the stronger piece. The normal Stratego rules continue to work. If you attack a 4 and a 7, the opponent&#39;s 4 loses first. Number 7 is stronger than number 6, so your captain loses the second attack. You always attack bombs first, so if one of the two is a bomb, you always lose immediately.</li><li>Apple of Paradise – The apple has a very special power that you can only use once during the game. By using the power you point to an opponent&#39;s playing piece. The condition is that you must reveal the location of your apple. So the opponent knows where your flag is now. If you have identified a player&#39;s piece, he or she must reveal it to you. He or she must then attack all four adjacent pieces around it with this piece. Each attack is assessed separately and again you attack the bombs first. Is the attacked piece a bomb and the assigned piece not a minor? Then the game piece immediately loses and the player no longer has to reveal the other three game pieces. Do you attack the opponent&#39;s apple? Then this is always the last move of the four and nothing happens.The player must capture this with his own piece. After all four pieces are attacked, or a bomb is attacked, the turn is over.</li></ul>  <p>This special mode from Stratego again has little to do with Assassin&#39;s Creed, but it does provide a new exciting mode and strategy. Hopefully the placement of your pieces will be a little different if you choose to play this mode from the classic mode. With this tactic, a player can easily eliminate the opponent&#39;s marshal if the marshal and spy are placed side by side.</p>  <p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Stratego-creed.jpg"></p>  <h2>Verdict</h2>  <p>Stratego: Assassin&#39;s Creed doesn&#39;t add much &#39;Assassin&#39;s Creed&#39; to Stratego other than a skin and therefore doesn&#39;t add much value to the game itself. If you already have a game variant of Stratego at home, this is not really an enrichment. Don&#39;t have a Stratego yet, but would you like it and are you a fan of Assassin&#39;s Creed? Then this is a nice edition to start with.</p>  <p> </p>  <div id="gmail-tap-translate"> </div>  <div id="gmail-tap-translate"> </div></div>
