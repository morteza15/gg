<div dir="ltr"><div class="entry-content">  <h4><span style="vertical-align:inherit">In the life of the video game enthusiast, dozens of accessories appear that one has to find something to do. While some accessories provide an edge, others are just a nice gadget. What about the Dualshock 4 Back Button Attachment?</span></h4>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">The Back Button Attachment for the Dualshock 4</span><span style="vertical-align:inherit"> , the Playstation 4 controller, does exactly what the name says. The device adds two programmable buttons on the back of the controller. You then want to press this with your ring or middle finger. Which of the two depends a bit on both the game you&#39;re playing and the configuration of the buttons.</span></p>  <h2><span style="vertical-align:inherit">How exactly does this work?</span></h2>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">You attach the rear buttons to the bottom of the controller. Don&#39;t worry, you can still connect a headset to your controller afterwards. This is because it is looped by the device. Then you get three profiles. You can switch profiles by pressing the touchscreen twice on the back. You can configure the buttons by holding it down for a while. You don&#39;t need a separate application for this on your PS4, everything works via the controller and can be adjusted at any time. The configured buttons then work as you would expect, just like any other button. The original copied button also still works. If you configure an O at the back right, the O at the front will still work.</span><br><span style="vertical-align:inherit">So you don&#39;t add a new kind of button, just to avoid confusion. Your Dualshock 4 does not suddenly have an L4 and an R4 button. This also makes sense, because you can&#39;t manually configure your buttons on the Playstation 4 in almost any game.</span><br><img class="gmail-alignnone gmail-wp-image-58683 gmail-size-full" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/dualshock-4-back-button.jpg" alt="Dualshock 4 Back Button Attachment" width="2048" height="1536"></p>  <h2><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Then why would you want this?</span></h2>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">So you don&#39;t get extra buttons, but you can copy existing buttons in a different place so that they are easier to press. That is a bit of the trick of this device and it therefore completely depends on which games you play. While playing with the Back Button Attachment, we tested extensively with the following games:</span></p>  <ul><li><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Rainbow Six Siege</span></li><li><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</span></li><li><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Tom Clancy&#39;s The Division 2</span></li><li><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey</span></li></ul>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">As you can already notice from the top list, there is one title that does not fit at all with the other titles, namely Assassin&#39;s Creed. So why did we include it in the test? Actually purely to find out whether the Back Button Attachment also adds a certain value in games where timing, precision and competitiveness are not directly of the order. Because in the other three games, the device certainly offers its advantages.</span></p>  <h2><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Rainbow Six Siege</span></h2>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Rainbow Six Siege is a competitive First-Person Shooter where you compete in a 5v5 match. A headshot is an instant kill 99% of the time, so precision is definitely an issue here. While playing Rainbow Six Siege, we first configured the back buttons as L3 and R3. In Rainbow Six Siege you will lean to the left as soon as you look through your visor and press L3. You lean to the right by pressing R3 after looking through your crosshairs. The operation remains completely the same, but by configuring these buttons on the back of the controller you can fully use your thumbsticks to move and aim. The extra action of pressing it to lean is not necessary, allowing you to lean more quickly from left to right,while remaining fully mobile by using your thumbsticks only to move and look around.</span><br><img class="gmail-alignnone gmail-wp-image-58681 gmail-size-full" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Siege-lean-scaled.jpg" alt="Leaning Siege" width="2560" height="1440"></p>  <h2><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</span></h2>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">In Call of Duty Modern Warfare, we set the buttons to R3 (Melee) and O (Slide/Bend/Ly Down). Although I am not at all into the so-called &#39;dropshotting&#39; it is again a way to stay mobile and use O without taking your thumbs off the thumbsticks. Very useful in a fast-paced shooter like Modern Warfare.</span></p>  <h2><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Tom Clancy&#39;s The Division 2</span></h2>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">The Division 2 is packed with technical gadgets that can help you in the heat of battle. Since you are constantly sprinting from cover to cover, it is important to be flexible. By configuring some arrow keys and for example squares on the back, my Agent could keep moving while I can reload while sprinting and keep looking around me while I replace my armor plates. Again, thanks to this configuration, I don&#39;t have to take my thumbs off the thumbsticks to perform certain actions.</span><br><img class="gmail-alignnone gmail-wp-image-58677 gmail-size-full" src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/inthegame.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-division-2-screen-12-ps4-en-25jan19_1548437841300.jpg" alt="The Division 2" width="1920" height="1080"></p>  <h2><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey</span></h2>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">In Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey you travel through Ancient Greece as Alexios or Kassandra and there are a thousand and one activities for you to engage in. Because there is so much to do, you may want to do it as efficiently as possible. Between traveling from town to camp or ruin, mount your horse and trek through the verdant mountain landscape to loot the necessary resources such as wood and stone. By configuring one of the rear buttons as wederom again you have your thumbsticks free to move and not look at you. Normally you have to take your thumb off the right thumbstick to press one of the iconic Playstation buttons (Or move your index finger in an unnatural way). With Î” you pick up all the necessary resources while galloping. With the Back Button Attachment you can do this without losing your freedom of movement,or without getting a cramp in your right hand.</span></p>  <h2><span style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</span></h2>  <p><span style="vertical-align:inherit">It strongly depends on the type of games you play, but the Back Button Attachment certainly adds something to your gameplay experience. Whether it&#39;s a simple convenience like Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey, or a real advantage during gameplay like Rainbow Six Siege or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Is it something for you? Think about whether this expansion can help you with your favorite games. Especially for the competitive players it is recommended as you do get an advantage after getting used to it.</span><br><span style="vertical-align:inherit">You get the most profit at times when you need both your thumbsticks to keep moving, but at the same time have to perform another action with the arrow keys or Playstation symbols. This combination does not go smoothly, but with the Back Button Attachment this is no problem at all. Previously almost impossible actions are now easily done and that feels great!</span></p>  </div>  </div>
