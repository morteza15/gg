<div dir="ltr"><div class="entry-content">            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Recently, Sony almost cut the price of its Playstation Now service in half. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Where you previously paid € 99.99 for a year, you now pay the same as for Playstation Plus, namely € 59.99. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This price already makes the service more than worth it for a number of obvious reasons, but we still take a critical look.</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Along   with the news that the service has become significantly cheaper, a   number of strong titles appeared. Grand Theft Auto V, God of War,   Uncharted 4 and InFamous Second Son. The fine print reads that these   titles will disappear again in January 2020. Why? If there&#39;s one reason   why the competitor&#39;s comparable service is hugely interesting, it&#39;s   access to the latest first-party games from day one. God of War has been   around for over a year and even this one isn&#39;t permanently available   through Playstation Now.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Nevertheless, the offer is enormously extensive and diverse on Playstation Now. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Something   for everyone and you can even choose to download the Playstation 4   titles on your Playstation 4. Unfortunately this is not possible on PC,   but this would greatly improve the quality and experience. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can only stream at a maximum of 720p. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This   is not a big deal when you consider that you can play Playstation   exclusive games on your PC with only a Dualshock 4 controller. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">On the other hand, one of my favorite Playstation franchises is Killzone. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">And when playing a shooter you notice that it is much nicer to actually have a game installed. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You do get used to the latency and Killzone already has a nice delay in it, but you notice it.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Playstation Now</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   notice it especially with shooters. Before the release of The Outer   Worlds, I spontaneously felt the urge to play Fallout New Vegas again.   It works great. The game runs smoothly, plays nicely, only the gunplay   is sometimes a bit uncomfortable due to the small delay in it.   Previously, I spent hours amusing myself with the Sly Collection that   appeared on the Playstation 3. When playing this title via Playstation   Now, on the other hand, you don&#39;t notice the delay at all. So it kind of   depends on what you plan to play. Are you playing a PS4 title? Then   download it if possible so that you don&#39;t have any delay at all and can   just play the game at maximum resolution.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">So   it all works fine. Both on a Playstation 4 and on a PC or laptop.   Always try to connect the internet via cable if you have the possibility   to do so. Via the WiFi, I occasionally suffered from a grainy image for   a few seconds via the laptop. However, this only happened via the open   hotel WiFi and not my home network, where I have been able to play   almost without any problems so far.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This brings me directly to the first lack of service at the moment. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It   would be really nice to be able to download the titles on PC as well so   that you could play without internet access, but just need to go online   so that Playstation Now knows you have an active subscription. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The same goes for the Playstation 3 titles on Playstation Now. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You cannot download this on PC or PS4. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">As a result, you are obliged to stream them so that you have input lag. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   addition, you can play everything at a maximum of 720p with the   exception of the Playstation 4 titles that you download on the console. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I think the biggest problem here lies in the fact that the PS4 is not backwards compatible. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">How would this work on the PS5? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Can we download all generation titles on this in the future?</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Good prospects</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Undoubtedly, things look better now than ever for Playstation Now. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">We have looked at Playstation Now before, namely </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">2.5 years ago</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> when there were no Playstation 4 titles available. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">At that time, we already praised the library with over 400 games. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">At the time of writing, there are already more than 700 games on the service, including Playstation 4 games. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">We therefore thought it was a good time to take a closer look at the service and to look at the difference in 2.5 years. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Let&#39;s see what 2.5 years has brought us:</font></font></p>            <ul><li><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Price dropped from €99.99 to €59.99;</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Playstation 4 titles;</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Over 300 titles. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">So about 100 new titles a year.</font></font></li></ul>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It   just seems to be moving forward. but there are still some things we   miss. For example, 2.5 years ago we already pointed out that offline   play is a real loss for travelers. Not every hotel has WiFi that is   strong enough to stream PS4 or PS3 games to your laptop without any   problems. But what if we no longer need a laptop at all? Remote-Play has   recently been updated for smartphones. So what if Playstation Now also   comes to smartphones and tablets?</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Another lack is the range of Playstation VR titles. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It would not be possible to play these titles on a PC, but on PS4! </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There are a number of VR titles that we really enjoyed. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Yet many VR titles are still very compact and therefore the price tags for the short VR experiences are still quite high. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Including   these titles in the Now catalog would be a perfect approach to this   problem and might lower the threshold a lot more than it currently is. </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Check out some of our favorite Playstation VR titles here</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> that we also love to see on Playstation Now!</font></font></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">On a row</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Playstation Now has a very large and still growing catalog of games. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The addition of some major Playstation 4 titles is phenomenal, but even without that addition the offer is already very strong. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Sly Cooper, Ratched and Clank, The Last of Us, Uncharted, InFamous and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Almost all blockbuster PS3 games are included and then we have not yet discussed the Playstation 4 offer in detail. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There are, however, a number of flaws that we hope we will get an answer to in the near future.</font></font></p>           </div></div>
