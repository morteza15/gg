<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">FIFA, one of EA&#39;s longest-running game franchises, has returned with a new installment. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">FIFA 20 was released last Friday and we are now a week further playing the latest version. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Finally we see the return of street football at a FIFA game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Under the name Volta, EA tries to fulfill the wishes of the fans. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">After all, the last FIFA Streets was from 2012. Will FIFA score well again this year? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Or do we see the necessary drop-offs flying out of the stadium? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can read the answers to these questions below.</font></font></h4>            <div class="gmail-jetpack-video-wrapper">             <div class="gmail-fitvids-video">                         </div>            </div>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">All   right, the old principle of 22 men on the field and a ball. Whoever   manages to get the ball into the net the most times wins. The football   part has also been explained again, but what has changed in the new FIFA   20. The Football Intelligence of the game has been adjusted again. With   the Authentic Game Flow, every player played by the computer will take   into account the time, space and position of another player. This   creates more time and space for the player himself. In addition to that,   the &quot;shooting&quot; part of the game has been overhauled. This makes   shooting feel more natural. The tackle system has also received an   adjustment. The better your timing and tackle is, the better that player   will retain possession of the ball after making that tackle. In short,   EA has a </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">number of updates again</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"> brought to the game that might have been in extended DLC.</font></font><br> </p><img src="https://pic.gameich.com/images/i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XilsKZmWoBY/maxresdefault.webp" width="546" height="307"><br><br>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Careers</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In addition to the game-oriented updates of FIFA 20, EA has also made some changes to the career mode. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Of course you can choose again between a pro player or coach. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The nice thing about this year is that you can also choose the opposite sex when creating your coach or player. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Both career modes are fun to play. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">As a player you can of course choose to play just yourself or the whole team. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">And as a coach you can choose to play the match yourself or have it simulated. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The off-game menu is simple and easy to handle. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However, with the coach mode I miss a lot of options. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But that&#39;s more because I&#39;m used to Football Manager.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The biggest downer, however, is the lack of voice acting. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">As a coach you give press interviews and you have conversations with the players and their representatives. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The scenes are well developed and the animations run smoothly. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However, the standard sentences that come back in every conversation, you see in the subtitles. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">EA could have hired a number of voice actors for this to record these kinds of conversations. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The conversations now feel empty and soulless and certainly do not invite me to do more than necessary. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A missed opportunity from EA to give the career mode some more depth.</font></font><br> </p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Volta</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Volta   is EA&#39;s answer to the high demand for a new FIFA Streets game. Just   like in normal FIFA 20, in Volta you can play a story to play yourself   to the top. During this story mode, you unlock new locations to play,   each with its own "stadium" and challenges. Once unlocked, these   locations can be revisited in the other Volta: Volta Tour game modes. Volta League is the online part where you compete against players from   all over the world. Strangely enough, EA has now added voice acting to   all scenes. Which then gives me more reason to ask myself, why didn&#39;t   they do that with the career mode of the normal FIFA section as well.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">FIFA   Volta is a nice addition to FIFA 20. Still, I would have preferred to   see them come up with a separate game for street football. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Perhaps they could have worked it out better than what they have done now. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It feels more like a sense of duty towards the fans now.</font></font><br> <br></p>            <h3><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict FIFA 20</font></font></h3>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">FIFA   20 is broadly the same as its predecessor. Of course, the game has been   provided with some new updates to make it feel a lot more realistic   again. The tackles have been modified and made more difficult, but when   you can do that well it is very satisfying. And that also applies with   the overhaul of the &quot;shooting&quot; system. This also takes some getting used   to, but once you get the hang of it, you put the balls in the net here   and there. Career modes are fun entertainment in between playing   football. It&#39;s just a shame that the scenes that go with it don&#39;t   contain any voice acting. With the standard sentences, we would have   expected EA to frame them with a voice as well. FIFA Volta feels like a   necessary added mode to give Street&#39;s fans their way. While Volta is fun   to play and close to the fun of Streets,I would have preferred Volta to   be a standalone game. Then EA could have made a little more of it and   given a little more love.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">   All in all FIFA 20 is another great football game and will undoubtedly   satisfy enough gamers until the next part which will of course come   again next year.</font></font></p></div>
