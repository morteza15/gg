<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Six years after its original release, Ni No Kuni returns in the form of a remaster. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The game that was made in collaboration with studio Ghibli is still beautiful with its excellent world building and animation. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But this time in slightly higher resolutions.</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The story, of course, has remained the same. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This isn&#39;t a director&#39;s cut, it&#39;s simply a remaster. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There are therefore no new features. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Anyone who played the game six years ago will enjoy the remaster just as much. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The Ni No Kuni remaster may be better suited for people who haven&#39;t been able to play the original game.</font></font><br> <br></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Story</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Players   take on the role of Oliver and start out in the quiet village of   Motorville. When Oliver&#39;s mother dies, he must make the journey to   another world in hopes of getting her back one day. He is accompanied by   Drippy, a strange fairy-like creature with a lantern on his nose. The   voice acting that was used for Drippy makes the game perhaps the best in   the English dub. Drippy is one of the most enjoyable partners a JRPG   can offer you. Although he can sometimes talk a little too much, he   always remains very capable.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However, Ni No Kuni will take you by the hand. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Drippy plays a major role in this. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">During your journey you will learn new games and tricks that can help you solve puzzles. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">But whether you&#39;re up against a huge boss or facing a big puzzle, Drippy will always tell you what to do. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Those who expect a big challenge will not feel at home in this game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Ni No Kuni therefore does not like the challenge. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The story and the beautiful animations that come with it ensure that this is a game that will stay with you.</font></font></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Gameplay</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Ni   No Kuni plays like a typical JRPG with slightly different combat   systems. Players will have to walk over a world map in a top down like   view and can enter an area every now and then. Whether it&#39;s cities,   caves, forests or mountains, the camera will change and show more   detail. In these areas, many NPCs are waiting with their own problems   and quests for you to solve for them. The completionist will therefore   be busy for hours with Ni No Kuni.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">On   the large world map you will be given different options to move around.   So you will eventually have to leave for other islands to continue the   story. Enemies you will encounter in the form of blob-like creatures or   one of the familiars. An enemy encounter with familiars will usually   consist of a fight against several of the creatures. So it will not be   the case that you only compete against the enemy that you have seen on   the map. If you have a lower level than the enemies they will run   towards you when they see you. If you&#39;ve made it to a higher level than   the enemies in an area, they will run away in fear. Sometimes, though,   it&#39;s worth going after the enemies because they give you a lot of EXP or   items every now and then.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However,   you will also be able to obtain items through alchemy. Players can mix a   certain number of items to achieve new results. In it you will have the   choice to follow recipes or to choose a mix and match option. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   combat in Ni No Kuni consists of a turn-based construction in which you   can move freely. This adds a strategic element as you can position   yourself to avoid enemy attacks. During the battles you will use   familiars. These are creatures you&#39;ll be up against more often. If you   manage to impress these creatures, they will make themselves available   to be added to your team.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This   will also give you the opportunity to build a diverse team in addition   to the characters you encounter with familiars that all have their own   strengths and can also make a metamorphosis to change into a stronger   form. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This system gives the combat a slightly more dynamic feel than most turn based games can offer you.</font></font><br> <br></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Playtime</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Ni No Kuni is a really long game. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The storyline alone will keep you busy for many hours. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Whoever still goes out to complete all errands, side quests and missions will be busy for weeks. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You can also choose to collect all spells, familiars and weapons. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">However, Ni No Kuni is not a game where you will need that. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Depending   on which difficulty you choose, that will of course be slightly more or   less, but it is not a game in which you will have to grind a lot. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">If you don&#39;t make too much effort to avoid enemy encounters, you will never be below the level that is recommended for an area.</font></font></p>            <h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Â Conclusion</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Anyone   who is a true JRPG enthusiast will enjoy Ni No Kuni. Those who love   compelling stories will also be deeply impressed by the game. However,   keep in mind that this is a heavy text based game with a low difficulty   level in which almost everything will be told to you. Despite a number   of minor flaws, the combat, side missions, errands and extras will keep   you busy for a long time. Those who have played the original Ni No Kuni   will not find anything new here other than improved graphics. However,   if you miss the game because you have left the PS3, this is a great way   to play the game again. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">For   those who are not yet familiar with the game, the remaster is the   perfect opportunity to start on a beautiful game with animations that   are guaranteed to stay with you.</font></font></p></div>
