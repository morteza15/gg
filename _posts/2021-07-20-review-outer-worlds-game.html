<div dir="ltr"><h4><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Obsidian Entertainment, known for Fallout: New Vegas, among others, is back with a brand new IP. </font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit" class="gmail-">The Outer Worlds</font></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit" class="gmail-"> is a playing field for the RPG enthusiast where you are completely in control. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Capitalism at its best in space. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Are you for or are you against?</font></font></h4>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">I don&#39;t want to say it, but I&#39;m going to say it anyway. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The Outer Worlds is the best Fallout game since New Vegas and it&#39;s not even a Fallout game! </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Obviously, The Outer Worlds takes a lot of inspiration from Bethesda&#39;s RPG franchise. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Not very strange when you consider that the same studio was responsible for one of the best Fallout games ever made. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Still, The Outer Worlds distances itself far enough from the post-nuclear-apocalyptic world of Fallout. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This has both its pros and cons. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">We   spent a few hours in the unreliable spaceship to provide you with an   honest review, which you read on your favorite Spacer&#39;s Choice device.</font></font></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It&#39;s like the NS</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A   little later than expected, your character is awakened by an   absent-minded professor on a ship called &#39;Hope&#39;. The ship would take 10   years to travel from Earth to the Halcyon system. The ship&#39;s Skip Drive   has since gone to the Philistines, extending the journey for decades.   The corporations that hold all the reins in Halcyon have chosen to leave   &#39;Hope&#39; to its fate. No more hope for the travelers. Everyone was frozen   anyway (which meant that the journey would only take 5 minutes), so   nobody noticed anything.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The professor who invades the ship knows how to thaw you and you are now in a more distant future than you would expect. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">By having been in the freezer for a little too long, certain side effects have arisen. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   can slow down time for a short period of time allowing you to hurl some   highly accurate projectiles at your enemies to hit their weak spots,   for example.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">A real RPG</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   fun, funny RPG genre itch has been with me for a number of years, but I   can say with joy that The Outer Worlds has filled the void in this genre   well. The so-called &#39;your choices influence the game&#39; titles of recent   years have turned out to be nothing more than hot air with the illusion   of having one&#39;s own choice. This does not apply to The Outer Worlds!   Your choices actually have an impact on the game and this starts right   away in the character creation.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">As   soon as you start creating your character you will be greeted with the   well-known choices between woman or man, color of your whiskers, the   well-known tune. The next step will shape you as a character. You choose   an ambition that you had when drilling &#39;Hope&#39;. What are your   specialties? Your choice in this profession will give you certain   attributes such as extra points in science for example. These will come   in handy later on in the game in both dialogue and slog between the   planets in Halcyon.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It doesn&#39;t all sound very Fallout yet, doesn&#39;t it? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That&#39;s   true, but as soon as you finally set foot on the ground, you notice   that The Outer Worlds is more than just a continuation of the New Vegas   style. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">First, the open world is divided among several planets and space stations. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">This gives it more of a Borderlands or Mass Effect-like atmosphere. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Quests can thus take place over different locations so that you can be constantly on a journey. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">There is no indication of the time differences per planet, so you will not experience jet lag. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Promises.</font></font><br> </p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Less physical, more RPG</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In   addition, the world, or worlds of The Outer Worlds, are less physically   oriented than you would be used to from, for example, New Vegas. There   is less rubbish scattered and basically everything you can pick up also   has a direct function. Most things can be found in closed containers and   occasionally there are some cupboards and drawers that you can open.   You will not spend hours scouring a certain location because you are   afraid of leaving valuables behind. Loot also doesn&#39;t play as important a   role as I initially expected. Most of the stuff you find is demolished   for parts. You will need these to repair your current equipment.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   missions you do also take a little less time because you finish   searching a certain location faster. It kind of takes away the &#39;I&#39;m   going on an adventure&#39; feeling, but not to the extent that the missions   feel like shopping quests. There is enough depth, even in the side   quests and that is what The Outer Worlds really needs.</font></font><br> <br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The   game is more of a role-playing game than an action game. You shouldn&#39;t   be surprised at this finding when you consider that it is an RPG, but   modern RPGs tend to lean more towards the action genre with RPG elements   baked in for the bonus points. No, The Outer Worlds is a true RPG at   its core. And a good one too. Choices in dialogue are enhanced by how   you as a person play the game. Have you spent a lot of points in   medicine, or science? Then you can often use this knowledge in   conversations. In addition, your companions often interfere in the   conversation. Each of these has its own personality, with its own   ideals, which means that you often have very interesting conversations.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Another point that your choices have an impact on is the reputation system. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">In many cases you can choose to help someone, or a group, or not. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Soon   you&#39;ll be faced with a similar scenario to Megaton and Tenpenny Tower   in Fallout 3. Will you help one at the expense of the other? </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">You   quickly start leaning in a certain direction in the society that   Obsidian outlines for you in The Outer Worlds and you can express your   preference very well.</font></font><br> <br></p>            <h2><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Verdict</font></font></h2>            <p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The Outer Worlds is a true RPG, brimming with humor and plenty of depth in a spatial environment full of diversity. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">It feels like holding the love baby of Mass Effect 2 and Fallout New Vegas in your hands. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">And it&#39;s up to you to baptize the child, or sell it to the corporation devil. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Playing Obsidian Entertainment&#39;s new title feels familiar on the one hand and refreshing on the other. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">Especially   the recurring feeling that you are playing through a nicely browned RPG   where you take the reins yourself feels very good. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">The Outer Worlds sets the bar high for the next games in this genre. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">That&#39;s a good thing, because I think we lost that bar. </font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">To conclude, I say: "You&#39;ve tried the best, now try the rest!" </font></font></p></div>
